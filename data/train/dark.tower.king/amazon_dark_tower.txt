A Well-Done Introduction To Another World This is the first installment of Steven King's fantasy series, The Dark Tower, which follows the story of the Gunslinger Roland, the equivalent of an Arthurian knight in the world King has created, and his quest to reach the Dark Tower in order to make the world right again. This installment tells the story of Roland's search for a mysterious stranger who may be able to help Roland find the Dark Tower. It is long on atmosphere and short on action. Therefore, fans of Steven King's horror works will find this book a distinct change of pace. However, the book will not disappoint you if you try it, especially if you are a fan of fantasy series such as the Lord of the Rings. Furthermore, you will find in later books that elements of King's horror world also exist in Roland's world, and therefore, to have a full understanding of King's horror villains, you have to read this series. The Gunslinger offers several intriguing views of Roland's dying world. The book is not devoid of action; there is a dramatic shoot out for shadowy reasons which one hopes will be better explained in the concluding volumes of the work. There is a lost child who provides the first direct evidence that Roland's world is connected to our own, and there is the introduction to Roland himself, a man who is capable of fantastic violence but still comes across as human and quite possibly kind (a fact which becomes more clear in later books). I recommend this book most highly to anyone who enjoys stories involving quests such as Arthurian legends, the Chronicles of Prydain and the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings.
Start of the series and writing seminars I've read a number of reviews of the series and have been told by friends how great it is, so I decided to check it out. Reading and understanding the intro/forward King has written in this revised edition helped a great deal. King wrote this book early in his career with the intention of writing a grand epic. He explains the author of this book at the time had not really found his groove so to speak and had spent a little too much time in writing seminars. One particularly revealing comment King makes about himself was that the seminars taught him to favor ambiguity over clarity and simplicity. He also goes on to mention when he revised the book he found many areas for improvement, but was able to leave the writing alone in places where he was seduced into forgetting the writing seminars by a particulary entrancing piece of story. I find this captures the book well. Reading it, the book shifts from a very interesting tangible plot to the Gunslinger slipping into ambiguous dreaming and past thoughts within the same page. You can almost tell where King has gone back and done revisions as you can see his 30+ years of experience fixing his amateur mistakes. Taken by itself, I didn't find the book that intriguing. Just average. Taken as a series I will definitely trek on to the future volumes as a number of people have told me the first one is sort of one you just have to get through. It's good it is a quick read and sets up alot of what will be revealed later.
Imagination to paper takes time At under 300 pages, "The Gunslinger" - the first book from Stephen King's "The Dark Tower" series - may seem oddly short, especially when compared to the latest volume from the epic, weighing in at around 700 pages. And still, Constant Reader, there are thousands more to go! According to the afterword from this book, it took King twelve years to complete the writings. He wrote the opening line, "The Man in Black fled across the desert, and the Gunslinger followed" while an undergraduate, the middle portions when "`Salem's Lot" was going bad, and was inspired with another concurrent writing: "The Stand." For King to have kept the Gunslinger, the Man in Black, Jake, and the other characters - and really the entire world of the Dark Tower - alive for so long in his mind is a testament to not only the power that this held over the author, but holds over us - his Constant Readers. Moreover, since the first publishing of "The Gunslinger," around twenty years have passed, a number of newer volumes in this series have come and gone - yet with this first, partially inspired by Robert Browning's poem, "Childe Roland," and partially inspired by reams of green paper (read the afterword to the book), you know that this was a very special creation indeed. I am not a fan of King's horror fiction. But when he gets down to writing about "other worlds than these," such as "The Stand," "Insomnia," "The Green Mile," and "The Talisman" (co-authored with Peter Straub) - there is no one better. His is an imagination to be jealous of. There is always a feeling that alternate universes exist, next to our own. King imbues his other worlds with just enough of our own so that we feel a tantalizing connection between our own perceptions of reality, and those that King entertains us (Constant Readers) with. At any rate, "The Gunslinger," at under 300 pages, is just right to introduce us to the world of The Dark Tower, and keep us on course, with a desire to continue (and to wait, ever so patiently for the next volume in the series) the journey the Gunslinger started many years ago.
Not the best book ever, but the gateway to greater things. I did not find The Gunslinger itself to be an enjoyable read, at all. The pacing was odd, the voice was bleak, the writing rather juvenile, even after a clean-up attempt by a much older King, and the ending was nigh incomprehensible to me. After reading it, I had absolutely no plans of pursuing the Dark Tower series further. But! A friend (to whom I am eternally indebted) practically force-fed me the second book of the series, The Drawing of the Three, and from there I was hooked. The rest of the series captivated me. It made me laugh and (toward the end) cry so hard that I occasionally had to put the book down and compose myself before I could keep reading. These days I'm an evangelical DT fan, pestering everyone I know to try the series. It's just such a bother that I have to tell everyone "You won't like this, but read it, the other six are amazing."
Gunslinger: Special Edition? In the forward to this new edition, King seems almost apologetic for the pretentious choices of his younger self. I agree that the language and feel of the first book never really gelled with the subsequent books, but I never saw that as a bad thing. Ultimately I don't think the changes make the book any better because I personally never thought it was "broken" to begin with. The added "easter eggs" are a treat, but the tone of the book seems less dark and Roland less ruthless. There are never any Greedo shoots first moments or anything, but King's attempts to make Roland a little more sympathetic are the moments I liked the least. I don't want to spoil anything, but the hard uncompromising, and yes, noble murderer portrayed in the original telling has softened a bit too early in this new one making his redemption seem slightly less significant to me. I understand the reasoning behind many of the changes and King's desire to get new readers into the series, and honestly, I still love the work as a whole. Of course I've read this book so many times over the last dozen or so years that I'm probably more than a little resistant to change, but my first impression remains luke-warm. New readers that haven't already read this or any of the other books in the series should do so immediately. While I may be ambiguous to my preference, either version of this great book is better than 99% of what passes for fantasy these days. This series is America's Lord of the Rings and so much more. I won't be surprised if years from now kids are painting "Roland lives" in subway stations around the world.
a bone-dry beginning I am a huge fan of Stephen King's Dark Tower series of books. I think that "Wizard and Glass" is possibly the best book he has written so far. I am always evangelizing others on the greatness of King's massive uber-story. Yet book one, "The Gunslinger," seems to be one heck of a stumbling block for most folks. This is understandable. The story begins with Roland (the main protagonist of the series) in his darkest place. He has become hardened, unable to love. The story ends with him making the most heartless of decisions. "The Gunslinger puts the capital "G" in Grim. Yet this almost unbearably bleak backdrop is essential to what the story of Roland and the Dark Tower becomes. In it we learn of what Roland is--a "Gunslinger"--and how he became one. We learn of the treachery that has set the course of Roland's destiny in motion. Most of "The Gunslinger" comes off like a flashback wrapped inside a horrible hallucination. Bad things happen and there is no fulfilling end to this part of the tale. It understandably turns a lot of folks off to going any further with The Dark Tower. I am here to tell you to keep on pressing on. King's story is, in my opinion, turning into one of the most epic and worthwhile tales ever written. The dryness of the Gunslinger is more than compensated for in the following books.
So many questions, so few answers The hype surrounding the Dark Tower series finally got to me and I picked up The Gunslinger, unsure of what I would find. What I found was a stark, fresh, somewhat surreal and demanding (yet light!) experience that left me wanting more, much more. This first novel in the series finds the hero (for wont of a better word!), The Gunslinger, slugging across the desert in search of the mysterious Man in Black. The desert is bleak and so our the words - yet they have a definite beauty. Along the way The Gunslinger meets a couple of people (are they alive or dead?) and reveals some of his back history - a strange massacre in a town, his childhood friends and mentors and hints at a Dark Tower. Death permeates this book. We're not sure who's dead or alive. Something strange has happened with time - the main search right now is for this cause - and strange fragments of the "real" world appear through the fog - Hey Jude playing in a Western Saloon is one of the strange and wonderful images we encounter. Time itself is an illusion it seems and still the Man in Black is ahead of us. My one reservation about the book is that the final meeting with the Man in Black is a little anticlimactic. Perhaps that's because it's been building up but after the meeting we wonder why he was running at all. However, there is a lot of backstory missing in the book - obviously slated for the later books - so perhaps issues like this will be resolved. All in all a most strange but powerful book - well worth reading.
Challenge Yourself Lots of five stars here. Lots of one stars, too. Comments like "hard to follow". "Boring." "No plot." I would argue that the plot is so big, some are not seeing the forest for the trees. The books of the Dark Tower cycle are King's most important, not because they are the easiest to follow, not because they are quick reads, but because with these novels not only is the author is tapping into a collective mythology, but is tying all of his works (see "Insomnia", "It", "Eyes of the Dragon", "The Stand", and many others) together. In other words, these novels stand at the center of King's entire body of work, connecting them to itself and one another, and thereby lending deeper meaning to the whole (kind of like the Dark Tower itself, no?). This is an ambitious attempt, and one in which I believe that King is unique. And the guy is pulling it off. Now, as for "The Gunslinger." If you are one of those that were unimpressed by this offering, please follow this advice: Read the whole thing. All of it. That includes the "tributary" books like "Insomnia" and especially "The Stand." Get a feel for what King is trying to do. Then go back for a re-read. You'll be amazed. Admittedly the pace is disjointed, and if you have read King's other stuff, you won't be prepared for this. But realize that the sparseness of the prose, the disjointedness and abjectness and disaffection of the novel mirrors the desolation and madness of Roland's soul (which is in turn reflected by the desolation of the desert and the madness of the man he chases). Realize that in this novel, King is setting up payoffs that don't come until years down the road, that won't hit you until the second reading (and if that isn't the mark of a great story, what is?). Just to take one example out of many: Roland's massacre of the shanty-town of Tull seems excessive, until the end of Book IV, when we get the payoff: Tull is the remnant of the village that burned Roland's love, Susan Delgado, at the stake. The massacre can be read as Roland's revenge on the town. "The Gunslinger" is a book of subtle shades and undertones, and is not the best of the bunch (that would be "The Drawing of the Three"), but it is a perfect and impressive foundation to an ambitious and excellent tale.
Get through this one. You'll be happy you did. This is the first in a wonderous series about Roland the Gunslinger. Roland hails from Gilead, an ancient or possibly future civilization where the blood-line of King Arthur Eld is highly regarded as protectors of the world. Unfortunately, by the time we meet up with Roland, the world has moved on. Roland is following the man in black. We don't know who this mysterious figure is until the end of the book, but we do know that he holds the first clues for Roland on the quest for the Dark Tower. What is the Dark Tower? Amazingly enough, a lot of it is explained in this book, though it's hard to grasp the concept until one has read further into the series. The series opens us up to the concept of multiple worlds in multiple universes, all held together with beams, which are breaking and thus, the Tower is being destroyed. The Dark Tower series is also held together by beams. These beams are other King works. Any King fan should read this series because it opens up so many treats for the "constant reader." There are tie-ins everywhere. The Gunslinger is linked to the rest of the books in the series, which are linked to other King books such as Salem's Lot, The Stand, Insomnia, From a Buick 8, and Rose Madder (which is linked to Desperation and Regulators). Wow! All this depth and a great story to boot! As we follow Roland, his quest becomes our quest. Every journey starts with one step. The first step is "The Gunslinger."
The Gunslinger followed "The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed." So starts Stephen King's Dark Tower series, which has become a modern fantasy classic. This raw dark fantasy seriesstarts off in "The Gunslinger," a fragmented but compelling story of the last gunslinger, Roland. As the story opens, the last gunslinger Roland is travelling across a world that has "moved on." He's hunting a mysterious man in black, who holds the key to a secret Roland has been hunting for his entire life. He stops in a town full of druggies and religious fanatics, only to leave it partly ruined -- and still in pursuit of the man in black. But a part of our own world enters: Jake, a young boy who was killed in a horrible traffic accident. The gunslinger takes Jake under his wing, and along on his quest. Together they cross horrors and dangers -- until they find the Man in Black, and the doom that waits for Jake a second time. All for the sake of finding one thing: The Dark Tower, the linchpin of the universe. "Gunslinger" is only a small sliver of the vast story that the Dark Tower series has become, and it's also the most fragmented. For a long time the story-line meanders from one ominous thing to another, speckled with Roland's reminiscences about his not-so-pleasant childhood. Things only become earth-shaking in the last part of the book, where Roland catches up to the Man in Black. The world King creates is a nasty, desert-like place, part medieval, part postapocalyptic horror, and part old west. Sex, drugs, rock'n'roll ("Hey Jude"), religion and long-ago politics are mixed in with the basic quest. King's writing is detailed, raw and vivid, with plenty of shoot-'em-up action, succubi and mutated monsters to keep readers on their toes. The Gunslinger is like a dark fantasy version of those gritty P.I.s that Humphrey Bogart sometimes played. He's rough, tough, dark, he doesn't reveal much of his feelings, but he has the occasional soft spot, and his hidden feelings seep out rather than being obvious. Jake is a good sidekick, kind of naive, and completely clueless about this strange world he's been hurled into. "The Gunslinger" is perhaps the weakest of King's Dark Tower books, but the ending hints at the future outstanding developments. Dark, fragmented, and genuinely creepy.
one more opinion So...347 reviews, eh? wow. Well, no one will read this, but i'd like to say it anyway. I'm now into the 4th book of this series, and i have to say the gunslinger is by far the best. I liked the last two, they were even addicting once i got into them, but none like this one. the gunslinger (and if you do read it, its worth getting the new version with the intro to king's inspiration for writing this book. for a lack of better words, its cool.) stands outside the series. it's darker, its mostly just roland the gunslinger in a nightmare version of one of sergio leone's movies. the world, an admitted mix of "the good the bad and the ugly" and "lord of the rings", is so fun and dark and full of possiblities. simply put, the other books feel as though they are part of a whole, that they are a set in a series. the gunslinger's ending is open, but it feels like its own dark world full of creepy crawlies and cowboys. like i said the first time i read it when i was 13 "this is rad"
The best creation of King's imagination takes time .... At under 300 pages, "The Gunslinger" -- the first book from Stephen King's "The Dark Tower" series -- may seem oddly short, especially when compared to the latest volume from the epic, weighing in at around 700 pages. And still, Constant Reader, there are thousands more to go! According to the afterword from this volume, it took King twelve years to complete the writings. He wrote the opening line "The Man in Black fled across the desert, and the Gunslinger followed" while an undergrad, the middle portions when "`Salem's Lot" was going bad, and was inspired with another concurrent writing: "The Stand." For King to have kept the Gunslinger, the Man in Black, Jake, the other characters -- and really the entire world of the Dark Tower -- alive for so long in his mind is a testament to not only the power that this held over the author, but holds over us -- his Constant Readers. Moreover, since the first publishing of "The Gunslinger," around twenty years have passed, a number of newer volumes in this series have come and gone -- yet with this first, partially inspired by Robert Browning's poem "Childe Roland," and partially inspired by reams of green paper (read the afterword to the book), you know that it was a very special creation indeed. I am not a fan of King's horror fiction. But when he gets down to writing about "other worlds than these," such as "The Stand," "Insomnia," "The Green Mile," and "The Talisman" (co-authored with Peter Straub) -- there is no one better. His is an imagination to be jealous of. There is always a feeling that alternate universes exist, next to our own (or maybe, ours exists within a molecule in some other reality). King imbues his other worlds with just enough of our own so that we feel a tantalizing connection between our perceptions of reality, and those that he uses to entertain us with. "The Gunslinger," at under 300 pages, is just right to introduce us to the world of The Dark Tower, and keep us on course, with a desire to continue (and to wait, ever so patiently for the next volumes in the series) the journey that the Gunslinger started many years ago.
Against the grain... Unlike many people who have left reviews here, I view Stephen King's first Dark Tower novel, "The Gunslinger" not as something to be suffered through in order to get at the riches which lay beyond, but as an excellent stand alone novel. Lousy at some may think it is, I actually fell in love with that old version of "The Gunslinger". No, it's not your typical, linear, run of the mill story. If that frightens you, stay away from this book. It's written in an artistic, vague, almost pretentious way (King edited some of this out in the new version, but the core stil remains). Obviously some people find this annoying, but I love it. To me it is almost the novel equivalent of a Sergio Leone movie, because his movies can be described much the same way. Needless to say, I was more than understanding of King's admission that "The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly" was an inspiration for this story. So I very much surprised when I learned that King had gone and "revised and expanded" this novel which I loved. Blasphemy! I thought. Of course, I went and bought it anyway. My feelings on the new version are mixed. I like the additional scenes (almost like watching the cut-scenes on a DVD), but overall the novel seems to have lost something to me... lost a bit of that original pretentious magic. Slowly but surely, King has degenerated his Dark Tower story into just another one of his crazy romps where seemingly anything and everything goes. I, for one, will always prefer that mysterious, haunting image of the last gunslinger, following across the desert. But that's just me.
here we begin... Stephen King starts out his massive Dark Tower series with the words: "The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed." Quickly pulling you into this twisted world of fantasy and western and a great quest, you as Constant Reader chase the man in black, across the desert in a strange and frightening place in time. A little patience is necessary for getting into the story; it's not much like any King you've read before. As relentless as the gunslinger (who we come to know as Roland) is in his pursuit, it's also a little slow going. King does not give you much back story in this slim novel, although as you read the rest in the series you will learn the past of most characters revealed here (and many more). Roland follows the man in black through a small town, where he is forced to make a final, violent decision to save his own life. As he continues on his long journey, he meets a boy from Earth, Jake, who died in our world and has somehow appeared in this one. Roland and Jake continue on together, but somehow Roland knows he may have to lose the boy, as much as he has come to care for him, to finally meet the man in black. The Gunslinger is only the first of many in the Dark Tower series. It is not as long, as involved, or (in my opinion) as well written as the others. It introduces you to Roland's world, but you don't get to know much about it or him. Keep reading. The answers start unfolding, and the pace definitely picks up with the second in the series, The Drawing of the Three. It's a long journey, and a very fine and exciting one at that.
Re-read it! I read this book one year ago and was very confused. For me, King has always been a writer who created likeable characters, but this Roland seemed like a cruel lunatic to me. The story was also a bit disjointed. But, never judge a story when it has just begun. And this is merely the beginning of King's largest work (in fact, it ties together most of his other stories as well). So I read on. And after the next books (especially after "Wizard and Glass") I understood why Roland has become this "Tower-Junkie". So I went back to reading "The Gunslinger" again. (In fact, I listened to the audiobook read by Frank Muller. If you like the books, buy the audiobooks, you will love them!) And now that I see this whole work as one, I like "The Gunslinger" as much as the rest of the story. Altogether, it makes up the finest story I have ever heard. I can't wait for the final trilogy to be published in 2001, 2002 and 2003, if King stays to his word. If you like this series as much as me, don't forget to read "The Stand", "The Eyes of the Dragon", "'Salem's Lot", "Insomnia" and "Hearts in Atlantis", for all of them are very good, indeed, and crucial for the Dark Tower series.
THIS is King's Legacy "The man in black fled across the desert and the Gunslinger followed." With these first words King begins one of the greatest epics to come out of fantasy fiction in a very long time. Many wonder what Stephen King will be remembered for once he shuffles off this mortal coil. Will it be Salem's Lot, or The Shining, or The Green Mile, or The Stand? Those will be remembered the way one remembers Sir Edmund Spenser's Amoretti, or John Milton's Samson Agonistes, or Virgil's Ecologues. All are important works in their own right but all are vastly overshadowed by greater, more penetrating, works. For Spenser it was The Faerie Queen, for Milton it was Paradise Lost, for Virgil, The Aeneid, and for Stephen King it will be The Dark Tower Series. Stephen King creates a world of infinite depth and complexity in this series. The world he creates is one of decadence and misery. Baudelaire would have been proud, Eliot would have wept, indeed, the third book in this series is named after Eliot's famous poem, The Waste Land. The atmosphere alone would have made this a great book, but it is the character of Roland which makes this an epic. In Roland, King creates a modern day Epic Hero, a charater in search of a great prize, The Tower. This first book gives us only a superficial glance at the world of Roland, and I suspect it is King's intention to not give us an indepth look at Roland and his world in this first book. After one reads "The Gunslinger" one feels like a man in a thick fog looking for a path to follow. As one progesses through the series the path becomes clearer and one begins to see objects, that like magic, simply appear before them. Here we see Roland pursuing the Man in Black, an old enemy. He pursues him at the expense of all, including a dear companion. Yet, like a force of nature, Roland continues, unrelenting, uncompromising, unstoppable. His will leads him through monstrosity after monstrosity, horror after horror, tragedy after tragedy. This is the cycle we see in the first book and this is the cycle we see throughout the epic. It is Rolands will which makes him a hero, not his training as a gunslinger. And throughout all of the stories we sense that there is something underlying the very fabric of the story. A indescribable force that one cannot see, only feel, like a breeze from the wind. Is it the Man in Black's teacher, an even more ancient enemy to Roland? Is it a character that has not even been revealed in the first book (or even in later books)? Is it the Tower itself? It is Rolands attempt to discover that force that makes the Dark Tower Epic the masterpiece it is. And I say here and now that this series will be Stephen King's Legacy for future generations, just as The Aeneid was Virgils, just as Paradise Lost was Miltons. He may be remembered for other works but none will ever surpass this one. This is King's most advanced writing out of all of his fiction. I dare anyone to read this epic and prove my words wrong.
The beginning of Stephen King's best work The Dark Tower is quite possibly my favorite book series of all-time. Something about Roleand Deschain, the last gunslinger, and his journey for the dark tower has struck a chord within me. This is the first book of the series, and while it's not my favorite (maybe The Drawing of the Three or Wizard and Glass would earn that distinction), it's the beginning of Roland's journey and is how I first fell in love with the story. As soon as I finish book seven of the series, I immediately want to pick this one back up again, the series is that good. Also, I love the new paperback edition. I can't stand the cheap, mass produced paperbacks that were the previous Dark Tower editions. This is a much nicer, "softcover" edition, with a smoother, higher quality surface and sleeker feel and has a lovely redesigned cover. I look forward to getting all of the dark tower novels in the new editions! I will include a side by side with an earlier edition of Wizard and Glass for comparison of the new size/style.
It's not just a guy thing I've just completed the first in The Dark Tower Series, and I have to say, I think, this is one of King's best told stories yet. I was a little disappointed to see one review suggesting that this book is "a guy thing"; so, ladies especially, I wanted you to know (coming from a woman, mother, wife, etc. and long-time King fan) that this book has a little bit of everything told in a parallel world that will keep you turning the pages, in true Stephen King style. Roland, the last Gunslinger, is a likeable, and realistic character who shares a wide range of feelings and reflections that will make you love and hate him. His dealings with his women, his mentors, and his too brief travel mate, Jake, make him a rugged, yet soft-hearted hero, one that I will not too soon forget. The book is hard to put down, and will make you long for the next pages in the saga, even before you've finished.
Something for Everyone The enjoyment of this book/series truly depends on your personal interests in reading, so I have seperated my review into different categories relating to the audiences that it might appeal to. Traditional Stephen King Fans: This isn't the standard horror that most associate with Stephen King. It's a much broader book, with a strong base in fantasy. If you're looking for a good scare, you won't find it here, but will still be able to enjoy the familar style of writing you come to expect from King. Fantasy Reader: Most fans of fantasy find this to be very enjoyable, but will also notice a bit of a departure from fantasy in the classical sense. It's not a book that's filled with your standard princes, dragons, or sorcery, but contains many parallel elements. The worlds in this book dip in and out of our own, creating a deep mystery sub-theme. Definitely Fan-fic material. Stephen King Fantasy Fans: In a nutshell, this is your book. The series is by far the best in King's arsenal of fantasy novels, and you will not be able to let go of the characters whom you'll get to know so well. Don't worry, you'll be a Tower Junkie in no time. General Public: Very, very interesting. The books are rich with plot, and the inclusion of the characters' personal histories adds to the empathy that you will inevitably feel for them. My only note of caution is that this series is a bit hard to get into. However, if you can hold out to the end of the first book, the feeling fades and there's no letting go. ((Extended Note: Another perk with this series is how most all of King's more prominent books have worked their way into the storyline, some more than others. For instance, there are strong links to Salem's Lot and Bag of Bones, and anyone who has read such can easily see and appreciate the connections.))
An Amazing Novel First, if you are a Stephen King fan, this novel is unlike his other works. Secondly, if you don't like Stephen King's other works and you enjoy reading fantasy, you will like this book. This book is unlike any horror novel written by King. If you have read the Eyes of the Dragon, this book is similar to that. I read this book for the first time three years ago. Since then I have read the entire series and read this book two more times. It seems like King is telling two stories. One is of Roland's past life and the other is the situation he is faced with. I find Roland's past as interesting as the current plot. For fantasy lovers, I might compare Roland to Aragorn from Tolkien's work. One of the last great men of a great people. Willing to die for his cause and for honor. He is the best at what he does, he does not feel pain, he cannot quit. His task is to find the Dark Tower. Where he will find it and what it holds he does not know. What happens. The gunslinger is following the Man in Black. He tells us the story of a town he destroyed because of the Man in Black. We meet Jake, a boy sent from our world to Roland's by the Man in Black. We follow Jake and Roland across a vast desert as he trails the Man in Black. Nothing can keep Roland from the Man in Black, and in the end Roland talks with the Man in Black. I like this novel, I like this series. I highly recommend it.
King reads the first volume of his epic fantasy Most of Stephen King's books fall into the category of horror, but he has also touch on fantasy elements. In addition, many of his works have an epic quality to them; The Stand is one of the best examples of this. The Gunslinger is the first volume of Stephen King's Dark Tower. The book first appeared as stories in the Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction before being collected in a limited edition by Donald M. Grant. The book eventually appeared as a trade paperback available to all. The series is ongoing, with the latest volume to appear in either 1997 or 1998. The story takes place in a strange world that contains familiar elements (patrons in a bar at one point sing Hey Jude). The focal point of the tale is Roland, the last of the gunslingers. His quest for the Dark Tower becomes his reason for living. Stephen King is the reader of this audiobook. I have also felt that Stephen King writes as if he was talking out loud. This makes his reading more interesting and illuminating. While his voice is not trained, he more than anyone else is able to illustrate the world he created. He also is the reader on the other two volumes. I enjoy listening to audiobooks, but I normally don't buy them. Stephen King's unabridged works are exceptions and his own readings are at the top of my list and the Dark Tower series is his most interesting work.
Worthy of Tolkien "The man in black fled acsross the desert, and the Gunslinger followed." With these words, Stephen King began what is turning out to be one of the best epic fantasies since Frodo started on the road to Mordor and another Dark Tower. Much like Middle-Earth, Roland's universe (which we later learn is called Mid-World) is not shown to us all at once, but rather revealed to us slowly; we discover it as the characters do. Similarly, very little at first is revealed about Roland's quest for the Tower, just as the Ring-Bearer knows almost nothing about the task he must perform -- save that both journeys will be fraught with peril, hovering at the brink of disaster and madness, and that each may cost more than the hero is expecting (or willing) to pay. Roland in particular has lost almost everything he holds dear in his quest before The Gunslinger even begins; the first we see of him is as a lone figure, all but used up, still doggedly trailing his adversary west to the sea. In the course of this somewhat-episodic story, we slowly learn more about the mysterious Roland, and his strange world, which parallels our own so eerily (note the effective use of the song "Hey Jude", which startles the reader even as it provides an anchor of familiarity in this semi-alien environment). We meet Jake, the boy from our own world who was pushed into Roland's (almost literally) when he died in a New York traffic accident, and whose character has unexpectedly come to inform and influence the story as much as, if not more than, that of Roland himself. We encounter the darkly magical aspects of Roland's world, both in his encounter with The Speaking Demon below the Way Station, and in his strange, eerie tryst with the Oracle in the Mountains, surely one of the most atmospheric, best-written passages in any of King's novels. We pass under the mountains with Roland and Jake, encounter the hideous Slow Mutants (which provide us with a clue as to just how the world began moving on), and just as light begins to (literally) appear at the end of the tunnel, the bleakest moment occurs, and we learn to what depths Roland is capable of sinking to attain the ultimate goal of his quest. Along the way, we slowly begin to learn about Roland's childhood -- his training as a gunslinger, the day he witnesses a hanging partly brought about by his actions, the serene majesty of a Harvest Dance in the Great Hall, and the first inklings of trouble between his mother and father. Later, we learn how Roland's confirmation of his mother Gabrielle's adultery will force him to take his final test, and become an apprentice gunslinger, at the youngest recorded age for such an event. These flashbacks inform and echo the rest of the story -- i.e., young Roland's realization of his mother's treachery and Jake's growing certainty that his friend will betray him; the sacrifice of the hawk David, and another sacrifice that will grow to haunt Roland ever more deeply as time goes on. This novel, which according to King took the longest of all his books to write, is very well-constructed, a good story in itself which also implies that there is much more to be discovered in the successive volumes (and this has indeed proved to be true). Most of all, I love the implications of the final chapter, the long palaver between Roland and the man in black, which suggests that not only is Roland's universe dying, it may be nothing more than a mote of dust within another, vaster universe. This concept is hardly original to King (even he admits he got it from someone else), but rarely have I seen it so well-executed as it is here. In fact, the entire story is infused with the idea that Roland's world, moving on as it is, is just one of many continua that are endangered in this story. Jake's final words to Roland, in fact ("Go, then. There are other worlds than these.") would indicate that this is in fact so. Roland's strange, threatening, yet somehow beautiful world -- much like Middle-Earth -- is one of the best settings for a fantasy/quest story that I have ever seen, and the more that is revealed, the more enchanted I am. Roland and his journey may not be exactly on a par with Tolkien's tale of Frodo and the One Ring -- but it's pretty damned close. King's most ambitious work may well turn out to be one of the best fantasy epics ever created -- and if you haven't started it yet, you really should.
Genesis of Stephen King's Epic Series To say that The Gunslinger is a grand western tale would be wrong. To say that it is a grant fantasy would be wrong. The same goes for science fiction. Well, what is this strange thing? The Gunslinger is truly a unique reading experience, successfully managing to roll off as one genre and then promptly switching to another. This story, the tale of Roland the Gunslinger and his search through a dizzying wasteland for the elusive Man in Black, is enigmatic in itself, simply a small appetizer for the real complexity of the series. All to often it has been singled out for its utter weirdness, its individuality from King's other works and also of the rest of the series. It is a very distanced and forshadowing tale, best read alone, perhaps with a popkin (sandwich) on one side of you and light from a devil-grass fire. This, being Stephen King's grant epic and all, could only be compared to the works of Tolkien or Peake of the Gormenghast series as being a tale of magic and quest, but as for everything else... The Gunslinger, just as its cold hero, stands out in the crowd. The breath-taking realism of the characters in this strange world is almost scary: the border-dweller Brown, the sexual bar-keeper Alice, the mad preacher Sylvia Pittson, and of course, the boy from New York Jake. Roland himself, in his stubornly narrow view of anything in the world besides the Man in Black and his Tower, is a study in the western loner (think Eastwood's "Man With No Name") so openly simple and yet mind-numbingly complex in nature. An instant classic, this revised version of the 1981 book is a true joy for all fans of the quest, the magic, the horror, and the western. Become a Tower-Junkie with the rest of us.
Finally! The Gunslinger was my first non-movie view of Stephen King's world and boy, I was impressed. I went in expecting a fast-moving, horror-ridden novel that would leave me sleepless for a week. It was well-paced, and it did have its moments where your hart gives a lurch or two, but if it left me sleepless, it was because this novel just ROCKS. It's difficult to find a fantasy that can really make you sit back and think. We've got plenty of fantasy, but the struggle is to find something deep and thought-provoking. I finally found the object of months of searching...a novel that isn't predictable, too "mushy with theme", is dark but not in an unsettling fashion, and can make me think.. It's name is The Gunslinger and it is the best new novel (in the since that I haven't read it before) that I've read in a while. It has believeable characters and dialogue, a hint of magic and mystery, a truly intriguing setting, great writing..and most importantly, a healthy dose of thought-provoking ideas. And if that isn't the basis of a great novel and series in the making, then I don't know what it is. A full-hearted recommendation to deep fantasy lovers.
Hesitant at first, but now a fan I've been unsure of the Dark Tower series for a while. I've never been a big fan of King's other works and was hesitant to really get into his most complex and epic work. I was wrong. This is great literature, forget science fiction or fantasy, at its best. The Gunslinger is in many ways the perfect introduction to a long serial epic such as The Dark Tower. It's not too long and does a great job of defining both the main character of the series as well as his ultimate goal. Motivation, friends and enemies can all be fleshed out later. The length is great because, if you turn out not to be a fan, you haven't invested yourself in a massive work (I'm thinking of friends who sloughed through Dune only to find it wasn't their cup of tea). If you've never read a Stephen King book before, don't take this as an indication of his other work. It's different, but in a very good way.
In the beginning... The Gunslinger begins the saga of Roland, an old west style gunfighter lost somewhere in a strange parallel world. It is a classic story of good vs. evil and only begins a race to the mythical Dark Tower. This book is a short fast read that sets up the plot for the Dark Tower series. The characters are imaginative and interesting, although King leaves allot of holes in the puzzles their pasts (to be pieced together in later installments). As a stand-alone book, it's average King but it's obviously essential if you want to try on this epic multi-book quest. A decent read that will leave you scrambling for answers in Part 2.
3 stars as a standalone, 5 when considering the series The Gunslinger is a worthy introduction to the world of Roland and his quest for the Dark Tower. It sows the seeds for what is shaping up to be a definitive, ingenius masterpiece of a series. A very short novel, but it gets its job done. It gives us an overall character sketch of Roland and his obsession, gets Jake into the mix early, and tells the tale of a bit of adventure in the final days before Roland finally meets Walter, the man in black. Besides its foretelling and awesome conclusion, The Gunslinger, when considered alone, is little more than an adventure story in a strange world (albeit beautifully told, as always when discussing the King). When considered with the entire series, it becomes obvoius that King is deliberately laying the ground for something absolutley huge. So go ahead, read this one (You can do it in one sitting, I know you can), and then pick up The Drawing of the Three. Now that's classic King.
A Slow Start to a Magnificent Series When I read the original version of this book, I would have only given it 2 stars. It was dry and incomprehensible, I had no idea what King was getting at. Normally, I'm not a fan of authors editing their works "after the fact", but King has succeeded in making the book more enjoyable and understandable by his later year editing. This new edition, I would put at 3.5 stars, but decided to round it down to 3, since it took King 2 tries to get it (and also because I suspect that the book making more sense is in part due to my having read the other books in the series.) I especially appreciated the forward King wrote discussing his vision for the book (a cross between The Good, The Bad, & The Ugly and The Lord of the Rings.) This helped me understand the picture he was trying to paint in the book, because honestly, when I first read the book, I didn't "get it" at all. This book is the first of a 7 book series that presents a wonderful story of alternate universes and time travel, and how time and alternate universes are all entwined. But, little of that is present in this 1st book, which is basically a "prologue" to the other 6 books. This book is short (by King standards) and doesn't cover much ground. The book introduces the main character Roland, and gives a small bit of history of Roland and some vague hints of his quest and the future. The rest of the series does get better, and the events in this book will make more sense as one reads on in the series.
The book that started it all! I received this book as a Christmas present in 1988, and even as a 15 year old had it finished by Boxing Day! I became totally engrossed in the storyline and was fascinated at the images and characters it introduced. I'm not sure if King realized when he wrote this story that it would develop into the monster that he's just about to complete with the publication of the final book in a few weeks. This book will leave more questions than it answers, and readers should not expect to read it and be totally fulfilled. This book just hints at the history, tragedies and issues of Roland's life - it's a fast, easy read that gives readers enough to want to leap into the next chapter; "The Drawing of the Three".
Bah! why they gotta put his picture on the back of my book!? I've read a handful of his, seen a coupla movies; I don't appreciate the gore, but his mind-leviathons are appreciated & i figured, "a whole world created out of Stephen King's brilliant imagination?...i gotta try THIS!" (besides, he keeps extending it, which=super-kool...) "I wanted to get inside my readers' defenses, wanted to rip them and ravish them and change them forever with nothing but story" -the man
Most Original fantasy world since Tolkien----Incredible book I recently read the new and revised version of "The Gunslinger", having read the original a few years ago. This new version is easier to read and foreshadows the other books much better than the original. Its an incredible work, and I recommend this series to anyone interested in Fantasy, Science Fiction, or even fans of King's horror. The Gunslinger is at heart a fantasy epic tale, but it is set in a western/fantasy world with science fiction elements. I know that sounds vague but once you read the book you will realize how accurate it is. It is impossible to classify as a single genre because the world King has created is so original. Very Dynamic characters (who change over time and are not just painted black and white) with great characterization, interesting character interactions, moral issues raised, and the fact that this is the beginning of a series which only gets better and better instead of worse and worse, make this book a must have for any fan of SF, Fantasy, or King's work in general. Unlike a lot of the other Fantasy epic series out there, This one has an end in sight. All of the books will be out by september of 2004, so no worrying about when the series will finish. Also, don't think that this is going to be horror just because it is written by King. He sprinkles in some scenes where they are appropriate, but this book is very different from most of his other works in that regard. Roland, the main character, uses his guns and wits to pursue Walter, the man in black (a wizard or priest or something else?) across the great desert. He must catch Walter to interrogate him about Roland's greater goal: The Dark Tower, Lynchpin of time and space, which happens to be falling apart. Along the way, he deals with many problems, some simply from the terrain and some which are traps laid by the man in black. To tell more would give things away. The Gunslinger (and the whole series for that matter) has something for everyone. It has great characters, a moving story, one of the most original worlds since Tolkien, and of course the beautiful prose which has made S. King the world's best selling author. It has pistol wielding cowboys, chivalrous medieval societies, wizards, demons, interdimensional travel, mutants, ancient machines from the great societies of the past and much much more. I cannot recommend this book highly enough. It will open up your imagination and change how you look at the originality of fantasy/Sci-Fi literature. As many other reviewers have mentioned, you will appreciate it more after reading its sequels, but this revised edition is still worthy of 5 stars as a stand alone text.
Vintage King & A Great Series' Opener! Stephen King's fantasy/western, "The Gunslinger," is the first of the books that comprise the extraordinary "Dark Tower" series. Roland Deshayn, or Roland of Gilead, is the last of a long line of noble gunslingers. He inhabits a world that has "moved on," or is in the process of dying, and what remains is a wasteland. A man of few words, this enigmatic epic hero, (I picture Clint Eastwood as a younger man), pursues his nemesis, a sorcerer named Walter, the elusive "man in black," leaving behind a trail of bloodshed. Most of the blood is shed by Roland's own hand, as he is forced to make crucial decisions, "degrading to his spirit," in order to continue with his quest to seek The Dark Tower, the "nexus of all worlds." As Roland makes his way across the brutal heat of the desert, the reader learns about the Gunslinger's past, and his knightly quest, through a series of flashbacks to an earlier time. Although nothing specific is described in this book, it is apparent that there were problems dealing with violence and revolution in Gilead, and a terrible betrayal - all provoked by Marten, Roland's father's court magician, a much greater sorcerer than Walter. These events could have precipitated the destruction and misery that is the present state of affairs in Mid-World. Roland's premature coming-of-age rite is described, however, as are the relationships of his youth, and a bloody showdown with the entire town of Tull. Through these episodes, one gets a clear image of a man, mature beyond his years, who has seen much and done more. And he accepted his fate long ago, while still a boy, with a foreshadowing of all the anguish he would cause and be caused on his quest. On his journey, Roland meets a man, a lone corn farmer at the edge of the desert. He is offered a meal, a bed and cool water, as well as some rare conversation with the farmer and his talking raven. Later on the trail, he meets the boy Jake at an abandoned way station. Jake was killed in a previous life on what seems to be earth, (NYC) - his death was caused by the man in black. Roland, although portrayed as emotionless and cold in his pursuit of justice, does develop an extremely strong attachment to the boy. The Gunslinger finally catches-up to the man in black for a final confrontation. The dark sorcerer tells Roland's future with a deck of Tarot cards and then dies. Obviously, as the series continues, Roland's journey will be a long one - after all, it has to last through seven books. "The Gunslinger" is almost guaranteed to travel through several different worlds before he reaches the Dark Tower. His next stop, in "The Drawing of the Three (The Dark Tower, Book 2)," will be the Western Sea. Author King sets a mood of total solitude here, a loneliness that is almost chilling. And the scenery is as empty, solitary, and almost as devoid of life as Roland's journey. I am aware that there are several characters in this novel, and not all of them exist in the past - but one is always left with the feeling that Roland is completely alone, with the man in black ahead of him, the only other living creature. The quest for the Tower is the only thing of import. Everyone and everything else is secondary. This series is supposedly inspired by Robert Browning's poem "Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came." This edition has been revised and expanded by the author. In his new introduction, King also credits J.R.R. Tolkien's "The Lord of the Rings Trilogy," and Sergio Leone's terrific spaghetti western "The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly," as having inspired "The Dark Tower books. I found it difficult to put this very well written volume down and can't wait to begin the next episode. Highly recommended. JANA
A little on the fence... I had avoided this series simply because it was more science fiction than horror. Stephen King is one of the greats in the horror genre and I wasn't sure I wanted to explore the science fiction side because I didn't want to have to say "meh, I really didn't like it." That said, I started the tower series with an open mind and little expectation. If I have to be completely open, I probably only read it because they're making the movie... Anyway, I liked it. Was it one of his greatest hits? No, not for me, but it held my attention. I want to see what happens next, and that is a hallmark of a good read, that it can keep your attention. So, yes I think if you're on the fence about reading this one, I think you should do it. You just might be surprised!
Don't believe the bad press And let me tell you, this book gets a lot of it. Frankly, it's really over the heads of some readers of King's popular fiction, mostly because this was written off and on between projects all the way up until its release. That gives the book a bit of a disjointed feel, to tell the truth, not within the individual episodes (there are six), but between them. All the same, the story and the writing here is wonderful, and should be appreciated by any fan of King or writing in general. Some of the negative reviews may draw their roots from confusion regarding the book itself--King doesn't do a good job explaining himself. Frankly, I'm thankful that he didn't. In a world where all the new fantasy reads like Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time, magic and the fantastic seem to have been discarded in favor of a kind of warped science. Don't get me wrong, I liked Jordan until the novels stagnated, but I didn't realize how much I missed NOT KNOWING how everything worked until I read this book. This story is full of the fantastic above all else. Walter, in particular, is a memorable character who I hope receives a treatment in the second "flashback" book of the series. The intertwining of popular culture (I can't here Instand Karma without thinking about the chasm scene) with King's own fantastic elements in Mid-World (a play on Middle Earth?) are at their best in this book, rivaled nowhere expect possibly The Wastelands. Even the philosophical jaunt into metaphysics taken in the sixth episode smacks of the fantastic, and it's wonderfully executed. All things considered, this would be a wonderful read even in itself, and it stands apart in the Dark Tower series as exceptional.
Revisiting Roland Deschain This new edition of The Gunslinger is wonderful preparation for the film to come in February, 2017. I read the series years ago, but Roland seems somehow more vulnerable, more brooding, and altogether a more sympathetic protagonist this second time around. The book is hard to put down, with suspense deftly woven through the pages, encouraging the reader to keep on trying to grasp and suss out just Where and When this strangely familiar, yet dark world and culture are, and what rules they follow--and why. This is master writer Stephen King at his very best.
Interesting read for a newbie First of all, I have to be clear that I am just an occasional reader of Stephen King. When it comes to the horror or fantasy/horror genre, historically I have been more a reader of Clive Barker The Great and Secret Show(although it's been a few years since I've read his stuff as well). I have read The Stand, but at this moment, I am struggling to recall what else I've read - I've definitely seen King's work in other media (film, tv). Regardless of my reading preferences/ history, I've had a very passing familiarity with this series, but it was only recently that I became intrigued enough to purchase the first book, The Gunslinger, and give it a shot. Overall, I was not particularly engrossed in it at the beginning. It seemed to start slow and the story of what happened to the Gunslinger in Tull seemed pretty boring. It definitely picked up towards the middle and through the end once the Gunslinger encounters Jake Chambers and we get a bit more background on Roland's history. After reading several books in the Song of Ice and Fire series George R. R. Martin's A Game of Thrones 4-Book Boxed Set: A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, A Storm of Swords, and A Feast for Crows (A Song of Ice and Fire), I was kind of taken aback at how short this book is, but I understand it's just the first of seven (now completed), so despite a slow start, I did end up finishing it in a short timeframe. It left me with a lot more questions than answers, and despite being slightly uneventful, I am now interested in finding out more about the characters, the world of the book, and where exactly it's heading (towards the Dark Tower, I presume!).
A story of Roland of Giliad; A story of all mankind. King takes his reader on a journey to the dark tower. This book is the perfect introduction. This book is not only about a journey of Roland of Giliad, but a book that takes its readers on a journey. From page one, It is me who is on the journey, hopeing to find why my world is falling apart. Roland is the character of mankind. King does a great job of making that character come to life and envelope all of us. This book relates a story that is ages old. Ever since humans have been seeking, they have lived this story. I would recomend this book to anyone who searchs for meaning and purpose in their own lives. It is more than a book. It will take hold of you, so be careful.
Hope you give these books a try and enjoy them as much as I have The Gunslinger is the first book in The Dark Tower series. For some it may take towards the end of this book or perhaps the second book in the series to really have it grab a hold of you, and for others it'll grab you from the start. Either way, this series is one wild ride. For me, each book in the series has left me jonesing to hurry and read the next one in the series and now as I am on the second to last book I'm forcing myself to slow down and savor it a bit more, although it's very hard to do. Hope you give these books a try and enjoy them as much as I have! :D
This is one of those kind of novels. Sometimes something grabs you about a book. You are not sure what, you are not sure how. Somehow a writer just is able to captivate and create something that is awe inspiring. I remember the first time I heard whispers of the Gunslinger. This was during middle school and I had read so many of Stephen King's books by that time. Yet this one was not anywhere to be found. Yet long and hard I searched, thought of, dreamed of, this mysterious book called the Dark Tower: The Gunslinger. Finally Plum came out with a trade paperback edition of this book. I got it RIGHT AWAY. I looked at the picture of the front. There, the man, Roland, the Gunslinger and that bird on his shoulder. I dont know how it caught me, but it did. My parents and I got into the van and started back home, a fifteen to twenty minute drive. During those fifteen minutes I was silent, a ghost, in the back seat, reading the first part, the Gunslinger, of this novel (the novel itself is a collection of a group of short stories S. K. wrote for a magazine and then was published as a limited edition hardback by Donald M. Grant publishing company). "The Man in Black fled across the desert and the gunslinger followed." That was/is the first sentence of this novel. It was like reading the Bible for me (as a Strong Christian, I am one who will hang on every word or at least strive to as I read the Bible), it was that captivating, it took me into a world that I had only fantasized about. Of course unlike the Bible, this book is fiction (which is too bad since after reading this book my friends and I started a Gunslinger reading club and we all wanted to be like Roland). A fantasy realm that is in my opinion just as good as the Lord of the Ring series. In fact, I will stand up and say very proudly and with much ernest that out of the whole 20th century, the only two series that are worth anything are LotR and the Dark Tower. King and Tolkien are the two masters of the 20th century literature. And I would fight the hounds of hell against anyone who thinks otherwise. Stephen King created a universe, that slowly but surely was connected to most of S.K.s other books. The Gunslinger is probably the greatest Male figure in all of literature of the fantastique. He is strong, but he is a romantic; he is intense, but he knows how to crack a smile; he is heroic, but he is not without his achiles heel. This is how a man should be, in life and in soul. If you want to read a book that with captivate you, that will bring you into a ghostly realm of action, adventure, romance, betrayal, theology, philosophy...then read the Dark Tower series, starting with this book. Your breath will be taken away and you will be launched into one of the second greatest epics known to literature. I will let you know that Stephen King has come out with a redone version of the Gunslinger. You can keep or take it, I really love it, but I also have to say...I love the haunting mystique of the original version that I got so long ago. The new version is somewhat changed here and there, there is a new way of introducing the first chapter of the first part. There are new revisions of characters. Still...like I said...that one version so long ago...was what really captured me and made me see that the Gunslinger is the greatest novel of the 20th century.
Slow Initiation Into the Series but Good! Having read both the Lord of the Rings and the Song of Ice & Fire books, and more that a few SF sagas of note, so going into the Dark Tower I kinda knew that I would be in for a slow start, a glimpse of something epic through gauzy back story and that's how I felt after reading book 1. Sure the reader gets a glimpse at the larger than life gunslinger (Clint Eastwood0) and the nefarious villain/wizard who is the Man in Black (why do I keep picturing Lee Van Cleef stroking the edges of his mustache) and there are hints to the ominous/cosmic construct known as the Tower, but so early on there is not enough of the details to truly understand the universe/dimension/reality that Roland the gunslinger exists in. The story has a definitive wild west theme and feel to it, but throughout hints and notions from other realities do appear. At one part in the work, a boy stolen from a more modern age appears to accompany Roland on his journey/quest. Mind you like any epic, this book is inclusive of great sacrifices and tragedy...some preventable and some not but by the end of the book, I have to admit that I was not as sold on why the journey had to be made and why the sacrifices were necessary but it was a riveting read for me. The conspiracies and the near magical fireworks that occur every time Roland draws his guns is spectacular. Alas, curiosity and the need to read more about Roland's pistols and poke is gonna send me onto book 2.
One of my favorite books of all time Third time I've read this. One of my favorite books of all time. Only 4 stars though because, as others have pointed out, it is a bit hard to read. I found myself reading passages more than once trying to figure out what was happening. This time around I read the kindle version and I used the dictionary feature a lot to look up words I didn't know. Of course without the dictionary I would have speculated based on context like I must have the first 2 times. I have read all 7 books and now I'm refreshing my memory in preparation for the movie. And knowing the rest of the story kind of makes it hard to ignore the plot holes of the Dark Tower series. If the evil forces that command the man in black are really up to no good, then why set out this path for Roland? Why not just take him out? ***SPOILER ALERT... DON'T READ ANY FURTHER IF YOU HAVE NEVER READ THE ENTIRE SERIES!*** OK so we also know Roland is in a time loop (this secret will be out as soon as the movie hits the theaters). When he finally finds the tower, he's sent back to the beginning of his quest. But why? To teach him to love? How will that serve the evil forces of the Red King? And more specific to this book, why did the man in black tell Roland's fortune and advise him to head for the beach (where book 2 picks up)? Why would this path be laid out for Roland and why would he just follow it blindly without realizing he's being played? But it turns out he's not played well because, in a sense, he wins in the end (long before he reaches the Dark Tower). Oh well, like a roller coaster that ends its pointless journey at the same place it started, it's still a fun ride.
Beginnings are always hardest... ...but this one is very good. For years friends have been telling me that Stephen King's "The Dark Tower" series is an absolute "must-read", so why it took me so long to get around to it, I'll never know. Upon picking up the first book to finally read I was given surprising amounts of caution by many, many people - "it's the worst of the entire series", "hang in there, they get better after the first one", "it's really awful compared to the rest", "I almost stopped after the first one", ect, ect, ect. Maybe I really set myself up to hate The Gunslinger, maybe all the bad hype made me feel as though I would be trudging through valiantly and forcing myself to finish. Luckily all of my fears were wrong - I was enchanted by The Gunslinger from beginning to end. As the story opens, we are immediately dropped in on our largely nameless Gunslinger in the middle of a desert on a quest to capture the elusive and ruthless Man in Black. Wild west feeling ghost towns mixed with saloon style versions of "Hey Jude" create one world that feels like a mixture of many. King doesn't make us wait too long before divulging the reasons why our Eastwood-esque Gunslinger has such a beef with The Man in Black or why he would risk so much and go to such great lengths to settle the score with a man who proves to be even more dangerous and manipulative as the story progresses. The Gunslinger is a short read, so those of you who aren't as enamored as I was will only have to bear with it for a little while - but the last three chapters make the journey completely worth it and set up an epic story for the rest of the series. I can't wait to dive in to the next book, and the next, and the next, and the next. Of course as I advance in the series I may truly come to find that The Gunslinger is the weakest link in an otherwise fantastic series. Who knows. Regardless - I give The Gunslinger 4 stars.
The Gunslinger - It grows on ya, what can I say The Gunslinger is not your typical Stephen King book (though to use typical and Stephen King in the same sentence seems a tad odd at best). The Gunslinger is one of those novels that you have to be concentrated to read, it has it's own language (kinda like Lord of the Rings in that sense) and will given even the most determined reader difficulty. I say all of this not to deter you but, just to warn you. In general it took me awhile to get through this book as it took me awhile to get through Fellowship of the Ring by Tolkien. The book overall I'd have to say is one those books that grows on you as time passes, and your exhausted somewhat by the end of it but, not really in asmuch a negative way.
Stick with the original What a disappointment! I originally read the entire Dark Tower series as it came out in print many years ago, avidly awaiting each new installment in the saga. The world King created and the characters who inhabited it were fascinating (as usual). Then, as part of a writing group I belong to, we did a "close reading" (analysis of the various aspects of writing) of the first three chapters of the book. One of the members had this "revised" edition, while I worked from my original paperback. There were discrepancies, and none of them beneficial. What I loved about the original Gunslinger was its sparseness, the bleakness of the prose that reflected the character of the gunslinger and the country through which he moved. King ruined this by adding unnecessary descriptions, "telling" rather than "showing" the characters. What happened, S.K.?
An Intriguing Start to a Great Adventure Before stumbling across this book in a local bookstore, I had never before read any of Stephen King's work. However this book got my attention. I admit that it took time for me to get used to King's casual style of writing, but the story alone kept my interest. This book, in fact the entire saga, is hard to classify under a single genre. Action? Adventure? Fantasy? Western? Drama? Suspense? Yes. All of the above. So if you want something fun and "different" - this is your book. King introduces us to a fascinating world and mysterious characters. Readers are given only hints as to who these people are and what is going on. By the end of the book, you still know very little. For that reason, this is a book for a patient reader who plans to read at least a few more books into the series. After I read GUNSLINGER I was curious to read more, but still unsure as to what my opinion of the DARK TOWER was. It was not until book 3, THE WASTE LANDS, that I became a "Tower Junkie". So, I suggest anyone curious about this series read the first three books before forming a final opinion. I like this book a lot more now, after reading further into the series. GUNSLINGER is a great ride. It has a lot more action that following books (which get into greater character detail). Roland is a fascinating character and his pursuit of the Man In Black is highly suspenseful. This chapter of the story can basically be classified as a "Western Fantasy", which is a breath of fresh air in a world with far too few original ideas. Roland, the last gunsligner, is all alone and in pursuit of a powerful Wizard, the Man In Black. This pursuit takes him through a deadly desert, a soon-to-be ghost town and into a mountain (not unlike scenes in FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING). Always on his mind is the mysterious Dark Tower. What exactly the Tower is and why Roland is going there is not revealed to us (directly). The Man in Black taunts Roland by making no effort to hide his trail, and leaving him exceedingly clever traps disguised in some of the people Roland encounters along the way. The closing chapters of the book leave the reader with so many questions and a strong desire to get their hands on the next installment of the series. As I mentioned, I have not read any of King's work beyond DARK TOWER, so I can not compare it to any of his other books. What I can say is that you don't have to be a Stephen King fan to enjoy this novel and that I greatly enjoyed this highly original work. Read this book.
worth it This is the start of a great series of books. It will make you wonder about all the possibilities that our universe has to offer . Read the Dark Tower. It's an expience you won't forget. You will won't be able to put the book down and as soon as you finish you are ready to buy the next one. -JenaLuv
Dark Tower Series Great, but Skip to Book Two! The Dark Tower series is outstanding. But episode one is often slow, slow. Achingly slow travel across endless landscape. Much of it was apparently written by King early in his career. Skip to The Drawing of the Three, with its recap at the beginning. Then enjoy, as episode two is great, with its clever travel from Roland's post-apocalyptic world to our world of the 60s then 80's then 90's. Book Two becomes much more sci-fi fantasy. You'll miss little by going into the more current Drawing of Three, a much better book.
Good but the original had bleak mystery I would start by saying I like returning to a book I read (and reread and reread) so long ago and finding it almost literally a new story with expanded information and entertainment. How often does that happen? I don't mean like a Hollywood reboot of a beloved classic. I mean that the original author goes back and adds a few clarifications and "finishing touches) 30 years after the fact. That is worth the price of admission. But. Always a but. The original may have lacked continuity with the later books. It may have been written by a younger man. And maybe this revision is "better" in the sense that a man with more experience went back to refine it. Ok. Personally, literature and music have always been interlocked. I never wished one of my favorite bands to go back and re-record an early album. I loved the album for the reasons they would want to "fix" it. But the world isn't a perfect place. Art isn't either. And in my humble opinion, it shouldn't be. That said, I still love the series but I felt the additions took some of the punk rock, the slightly jagged riff, the out of place string screech or feedback, and turned it into something a little less. But! The additions were interesting as I have aways hungered for more Dark Tower, hell, I would read the janitors account of its upkeep if the talented and prolific Mr. King would write it. So thanks! Sincerely. I will read the new and improved but will never give up my original.
Nexus of Time and Size I am glad I waited to read The Gunslinger until after Stephen King revised and expanded the first novel in his series, The Dark Tower. I bought the Kindle version and it was a positive experience to see the color illustrations, use the X-Ray feature that presents a time line for the important characters, and to search easily the Dark Tower Wiki via the Google link. I love Mr. King's style of integrating current language, customs, and preoccupations with his universe building fiction. The structure of Volume 1 sets the stage for Roland Deschain's quest for all universes' power nexus the Dark Tower, the nexus of time and size. Roland, the son of a gunslinger, comes of age as a gunslinger and embarks on his destiny to find the Dark Tower. He leaves from Mid-World, once a land of milk and honey, that has been destroyed by revolution. Roland has a mind that is slow, plodding, and tenacious but without imagination. Only this unique mind can approach the Dark Tower with its all-worlds power. Roland is the last of his kind. The great maturity of Stephen King's writing ability can be seen in the differences between his 1978 work, The Stand, and his current extensive revision of The Gunslinger first published in 1982. This revised 2003 edition includes concise descriptions of landscape, action, character development, and communication that are more exiting, engaging, and satisfying than before when he wrote about world existential topics. I have already bought Volume 2 of The Dark Tower series, The Drawing of the Three and am looking forward to reading the entire 7 volume series.
5 stars with a Warning! This book is a gem but it's risky business. Warning: Do not buy this book, risking your time and money, unless you are firmly committed to reading the second book in the series, The Drawing Of The Three. I read The Gunslinger, then The Drawing Of The Three, and have just started reading the third book, The Waste Lands. I couldn't put the second book down, devouring it as fast as I could, and I can hardly believe my good fortune in having five more books to go before the climax in The Dark Tower, book seven. Several reviews have compared The Gunslinger to The Hobbit - as a precursor to the rest of the books in the series. But The Hobbit is a book that stands firmly on its own legs. The Gunslinger is not. The Gunslinger only begins to make sense while reading the second book. There were times that I thought I'd never make it through The Gunslinger. I had tumbled into a world that didn't make sense. I was confused and disoriented in this new world. I was angry and disgusted and thought I had wasted my money. But I had committed to the series by buying the first four books and I had to get through The Gunslinger before moving on to the others, so I persevered. Thankfully! I highly recommend this book as your ticket into the world of Roland, The Gunslinger. This is Stephen King at his best.
Possibly Stephen King's most compelling book of all time. There are usually three reactions people have when Stephen King is mentioned. I love him. I hate him. And I like the movies based off his books, but I can't stand the books themselves. Whichever way you roll, you do have to admit that he's one of the most famous and successful writers of our day. He's often called the Master of Horror, however, very few of his books can actually be classified as being part of the horror genre. Oh, he does have his straight up horror novels, but the majority of his work is misclassified because his reputation is for horror, and that's what sells his books, regardless of whether or not they actually fit into that genre. He has stated in many an interview that he is a science fiction and fantasy fan, and has always wanted to write a grand fantasy epic to rival the Lord of the Rings. And if you look at them, most of his books are really more science fiction, fantasy, and thriller, rather than horror That is where The Dark Tower series comes in. He had an idea for the beginning of such a grand epic story, and he wrote it in high school. It was titled The Gunslinger and it is the first book that he ever wrote. It was published in a literary magazine, and later re-written and published as book one of The Dark Tower series once he'd gotten his foot in the door of the publishing world. The Dark Tower series as a whole has taken him decades to complete, oftentimes he would set it aside for years because he was basically making it up as he went along and couldn't think of anything to happen next. It was not until the famous accident when he was run over while jogging near his home in Maine that he realized he came inches away from dying and didn't want to snuff it before finishing his epic. It spurred him to get the final three books out within a couple years of each other and finish the series off. The Gunslinger begins with Roland, a Gunslinger, who is something like an Arthurian Knight if he were to have grown up in the old west rather than ye olde England, chasing after the Man in Black. Those who are familiar with other works of Stephen King will recognize Randall Flagg in the Man in Black, though his name is not revealed in this book. The world is dying around him, and through a series of flashbacks we find that the Man in Black is the cause of it. Roland pursues him across an endless desert wasteland, seeking vengeance for the deaths of his family and friends, for countless wars and rebellions, and the very breaking down of reality itself. Long ago he began a quest with his friends to find the Dark Tower, the center of the universe, to set things right, and the Man in Black may be the only one that can show him the way. As he chases after his quarry he encounters a boy named Jake, whom the Man in Black has transported from our world to Roland's as a means to slow Roland down. Being a good man at heart Roland cannot leave the boy behind to die in the desert and so they travel on together and finally reach the mountains beyond the desert, catching the Man in Black at last, at the mouth of a cave. He is given a choice, sacrifice the boy the next time they meet in exchange for details of the Dark Tower, and the companions he will need to find in order to reach it, or forever lose any hope of undoing the wrongness that is tearing reality itself apart. The Good? This is the very first book that Stephen King ever wrote, and therefore it is relatively clean, lacking the graphic sex and repeated use of the F word for which he is so famous. The story, though simple, is written in such a compelling way that it pulls you in, offering up questions about the past and the future of Roland that you can't help but continue reading to find the answers to. Roland as a character is well developed, with a clear goal in mind that he will do anything to achieve. The atmosphere and tone of the book are extremely well done. This book feels like the beginning of the grand epic story that it is. For the majority of the book, there is only Roland alone with his thoughts and inner demons. You might not think that to be very interesting, but King does it in such a way that you just can't stop reading. The bad? Stephen King is well known for the fact that he never outlines or plans anything before sitting down to write. He gets an idea and basically makes things up as he goes along. Though this is less evident in The Gunslinger, because the plot is so simple, and there are so few characters in it, you can still see where he just pulled stuff out of nowhere when he painted himself into a corner. The ugly? Stephen King uses a type of viewpoint called Third Person Omniscient. Normally, in a third person story, you see the story through the eyes of a single character at a time. You know their thoughts, their emotions, and their reactions to everything that happens. With Omniscient, the writer will give you thoughts and internal details from more than one character at a time. You're not in any one character's head, you're in all of them, and which one whose eyes you're seeing the world through can change at the drop of a hat, and normally with nothing to tell you that the viewpoint has changed. Some people, including myself, can find this to be confusing at times. It can also lead to the reader not connecting well with any of the characters. In a huge science fantasy epic like this one, it is vital that you connect with the characters, because you're going to be with them for a very long time. Luckily there are really only 3 characters in this book, so its easy to get attached to them early on so there's less confusion later in the series when more characters are introduced. All in all, The Gunslinger is a very good book. It lacks the hard language and sex that put many people off Stephen King books, and despite my dislike of King's writing style, it is very well written and thought out. It's hard to make something this interesting and compelling with a cast of only three characters, and he's done excellently with it. The atmosphere of the book is great, you can really feel the hopelessness of the dying world weighing on Roland's back with every step he takes, and the hope that he feels as he chases after the one man that may be able to give him some clues on how to set it right again. Roland's internal struggles play out very well, and you're teased enough with things to come and things long past that you want to continue on to the next book. As the beginning of a large epic the likes of which King wanted to rival Lord of the Rings with, it's rather short and simple. However, it is exactly what it needs to be to get this story rolling. Even if you do not go on to read the rest of the series, this book alone is worth reading for the simple reason that it is a perfect example of excellent writing and imagination the likes of which you would not have though Stephen King capable of, looking at his other works. I wish more of his books were like this one, clean and well written, rather than full of sex, horrible language, and not very well thought out or coherent. I'm giving this book five stars. It loses a point or two because of the confusion of the Omniscient point of view and a little bit of rambling due to King's making it up as he went along. Other than those two small issues I have nothing to complain about, not enough to lower it to 4 stars though. It was an excellent book that I certainly recommend you read.
Just get past the first book! Thats what everyone says This book is crazy hard to get through. It took me several tries. Everyone kept telling me what a great series it is and just get through the first book. Even the author says its rather different in the begging of the ebook edition as an insert. Stating he wrote it when he was very young. Hope the following books are easier to read like everyone says.
A thought-provoking epic novel! The Gunslinger is the star of an epic series: The Dark Tower. I was pulled immediately into reading this wondrous tale because I was influenced by King's other works. To start off, this book can easily be finished in a day or two, partly because of its length, partly because of the great way it's written. King explains a world he has created, known as Mid-World, and Roland of Gilead, the Last Gunslinger, searches endlessly for the Dark Tower, for reasons I will not discuss so I don't ruin the storyline for those of you who have never read this book. King uses a great combination of description and character-development, and he makes the plot run smoothly. As for the description: there is not too much, nor is there too little; it is described perfectly, so that you know just how Roland's expression looks when he sees an evil monster; so that you know how the mountains look as Roland climbs them, so you receive just enough description of the desert hardpan to imagine how sickly hot it is. This factor alone is just a sample of the great story telling witnessed when reading this book. And as for character development? The characters act as though they were in a real-life situation, simply put. Roland wouldn't say, "Oh no, here they come, I must beat them to the exit!" He would say something along the lines of a brief swearing, then he would run and complete his mission. Which is probably what anyone would do in a situation where you're cornered by *taken out to avoid giving spoilers*, don't you think? What makes Roland's character so unique: his weapon is not a sword, a dragon, and a magical fire spell, which all exist in the lame novel Eragon; Roland uses two revolvers. That is probably the most unique character I've ever seen in an epic tale. This is one reason why Roland is such a memorable character: he's unique from any other person you've read about in your life. You may try for the rest of your life to find a similarity between the Last Gunslinger and another epic hero; you'll find none. His personality also plays a role in this: he gains friends, but tries not to become attached to them, because he needs them to search for the Tower. This also makes him a unique character. And the plot: try all you want to predict what'll happen next. I've had feelings of, "Okay, I just KNOW he'll make it out alive of this situation." The truth? That you don't know who will die and who will live. I know, I know, you see this type of stuff in New York Times reviews, what with all the plot-twists they talk about in every book they review. But in the Gunslinger? It's true. There are actually plot twists existing. And that's what made me read this book for several days straight. And after reading the Gunslinger, you'll wanna read The Drawing of the Three. That's all I'm saying about this book. It tells a great story about an epic hero with a distinct and definite goal: to reach the Dark Tower. And he'll do ANYTHING to reach it. So I advise you to read this great tale of friendship, twists, conflict, and sheer terror as King unleashes a myriad of beasts and freakish monsters he himself has created...
Eager To Read the Second After reading the Gunslinger, I was left wanting to know more; to read more about the characters. I hungered for more story, and am anxious to read the second book. I am an avid reader, but generally if a book doesn't interest me by page 50, I move on. Fifty pages is enough to create an interesting read. Honestly, four out of five books I pick up, get shelved for lack of story. I had never read a Stephen King book prior to the Gunslinger, and didn't know what to expect. Add to that a seemingly western theme, and I thought there was a strong chance I would move on, just like the world of the Gunslinger. I didn't, and I enjoyed. I actually stayed up past my bedtime to read this book. (Yes, those of us getting old struggle to read past 10 pm. 9 pm is my bedtime) The Gunslinger, and Stephen King, far exceeded all my expectations. The book was a fast and fascinating read. A breathe of fresh air in a fiction-filled world of cookie cutter plots, cheesy hollywood-style characterising, and fantasy clones. In the Gunslinger we find Roland, the gunslinger, struggling across the desert to catch the man in black. The desert is vast, the world is dry, and population sparse. The gunslinger has several encounters along the way before winding up in a climactic scene between he, and the eternal man in black. The tale is gripping, despite many flashbacks where King fills in the crack with back story. While this could be called a fantasy, it is really hard to label. There are fantasy and sci-fi elements, as well as western themes, but first and foremost this is just a flat out good story about a man and his quest. In this case, Roland hungers for the Dark Tower. Having never read Stephen King before the Gunslinger, I have no reservations about recommending this book, and others by Mr. King. I will. The Gunslinger is a good story, and regardless of what "style" or "depth" of reading you enjoy, I highly recommend that you give this book a try. You won't regret reading it, and odds are, if you are a voracious reader, you'll aprreciate it even the more.
The last gunslinger. After reading a number of King's books and enjoying virtually all of them, I was drawn (like many of you) to THE DARK TOWER series. I just finished THE GUNSLINGER. It's a quick read at around 230 pages that quickly throws us into a world eerily related to our own. We meet Roland, more frequently referred to as "the gunslinger", a dark hero driven to follow "the man in black" for reasons you'll have to read the book to find. This book is unlike any other King book I've read to date (including THE STAND, DREAMCATCHER, THE TOMMYKNOCKERS, THE SHINING, and HEARTS IN ATLANTIS) and is aptly titled THE GUNSLINGER as this book is simply setting up a base for understanding our hero and the quest that drives him. King paints this picture through Roland's interactions with three main characters he encounters while chasing the man in black - a woman, a man, and most importantly, a boy from another time named Jake. I couldn't help but draw certain parallels between Roland's character and Paul Atreides of DUNE lore. Tack this onto the way this book is narrated - an epic story having somewhat mythological overtones that takes place far in the future (or in another time completely). If you've read DUNE, I think you'll see what I mean, but don't worry, the gunslinger would hardly be a messiah in any traditional sense. This is King we're talking about, remember? Thank God. THE GUNSLINGER is a great book because by the end of it, you'll find yourself immersed in Roland's world dripping with awe and wonder at the possibilities presented by the Dark Tower. It's like imagining yourself thrown into the middle of the universe - can you imagine the size of it all? And how absolutely small we are alone amidst all that space. Read it already.
A remarkable cosmic vision- of decay and dissolution... I had heard about this novel and the rest of the "Dark Tower" series for a couple of decades but I just never found time to get to them. I now see why King considers the series to be the core of his life's work. There is something mythological here, but not in any contrived and self-conscious way. The author ruminated on this book in his sub conscious for a dozen years before publishing- and that extra time for germination shows. This is no slapped together popular potboiler. King admits that he doesn't elaborately outline and plan his novels in his head, that they just flow through him in the spontaneous act of writing. So what we have here seems to be a direct channeling from somewhere else. I know it seemed familiar to me when I read it, just as Burroughs's "Place of Dead Roads" and "Cities of the Red Night" seemed familiar. It also struck me as very similar to the "macro dimensions" in Gold's _The American Book of the Dead_. It would seem that when we cross over to the worlds that exist beyond this one, we tend to carry the artifacts and landscapes along with us that we are most familiar with- including Gunslingers and the West. As for the world of the Gunslinger, it is "passing on"- for there is something fundamentally wrong with time and the fabric of existence itself. Everything is decaying and dissolving. The social fabric is unraveling and mutants and dark magicians freely wander the land. The old order of the King of Light and his gunfighter guardians is no more- Roland is the last of them. It is now his mission to find out what is happening that caused his world, and perhaps the rest of existence to collapse. To do that he must find the mythical Dark Tower. And to find that he must hunt down the Man in Black. What struck me here is the timelessness of King's model of the cosmos. We are told of the existence of countless worlds or dimensions. Yet all these worlds are connected by a tower- this is obviously the Axis Mundi, the tree or mountain at the center of creation. It is dark in this case, because this is a vision of a sick, decaying universe. In mythology it is the shaman that ascends and descends this great central pillar to try to bring order and balance back to creation. However, in King's version it is dark magicians that come and go. He even has the subterranean descent before ascension correct. Oh yes, a measure of the corruption of this world is the hero, Roland, himself. He is the last Gunslinger, the last crusader- yet he is also a murderer and betrayer.... Now that I understand the entire series is completed, I look forward to finishing it.
The gunslinger ap english A Reaction to The Gunslinger The Gunslinger is a more valid literary contribution than most readers would expect from Stephen King. A complex story of a man both more and less than moral and the beginning of his quest to save his world, it is shares themes of redemption with King's other masterpiece, The Stand. Roland Deschain, the Gunslinger, was a kind of knight/diplomat of the civilized but brutally straightforward land of Gilead where hard men with guns and near superhuman talents maintained peace and order. Twelve years after Roland's land experienced a revolution and fell to chaos we meet the last gunslinger on the trail of a magician who holds the secret of "The Dark Tower." A picture of the romantic yet unrelenting force of justice, the gunslinger sees the world in tones of gray and commits ever escalating crimes as his humanity begins to wane. On his way to the Man In Black, who is his way to the path that ends at the tower, Roland meets a young boy who died in our world and awakened in the gunslinger's own. Roland comes to love Jake but believes him to be a trap left by the Dark Man, which comes to be true, as Roland must choose between the boy and the tower. The flashbacks that tell the story of Roland's childhood and imply the nature of the world filled with "love and light" have a similar texture to White's The Once and Future King and lend a sense of majesty to Roland's lost life. The Gunslinger's recollections also hint at a world not as great as he thinks, a world where hurting children is a valid educational technique, the highest level of people are strong killers and the makings of revolution are already present. These segments only add to the rich story by creating a allowing a different perspective, through a different narrative position, and shedding a full spectrum of light on Roland's gray tale. In addition to King's usual horror, the reader finds a different use of language and adjectives that lends itself to a higher level than many of King's shock and grab stories. King's utilizes every bit of talent he has in writing sharp, short sentences that create a stilted tone whose word choice implies great depth. The world of The Gunslinger isn't supposed to feel whole but it does feel real and worth the attention. The phrase, "The world had moved on since then. The world had empted." (Pg. 11) takes on a dusty yet romantic quality and becomes a suiting basis on which the picture of a world gone wrong is aptly painted. After the first ten pages the reader becomes engrossed in this story and its main character. Of course, many classic themes in King's writing are present, the used deus-ex-machina and foreshadowing move the story along and provide for dead ends. The good versus evil theme is obviously carried through the notion of knight seeking out a means to redeem a dying world. The common King characterization also pervades this book, providing description both physical and moral that praises common Christian values and down-home sentiments. The quest for the Dark Tower, revealed at the book's climax as the lynchpin of all existence, and setting to order whatever is wrong there is an important enough theme as to provide the Dark Tower Series its name and to dominate most discussion and action throughout the seven books but it is the Gunslinger's story. The quest for the tower is the main focus of the books because it is Roland's quest, his focus. The Gunslinger is the preamble of that quest, the last few months of Roland's twelve-year ordeal to find the way to the Dark Tower. It is the last hurdle Roland faces, the sacrifice of his humanity for his honor, that makes this book so appealing.
Late to join the quest For a long time I resisted buying and reading these books. I don't quite know why. I like Stephen King. I like post-apocalyptic dark fantasy alternative reality. But for some reason, I just balked. Then I finally gave in and managed to get almost all of them within a couple weeks (except Wolves of the Calla (The Dark Tower, Book 5), which I've only just managed to track down, leaving me hanging half-way through for some months), and I started reading. What a world, what a world - and what a fascinating character is Roland Gilead, the last of the gunslingers. From the sounds of things, Roland is ageless, near immortal, and has been chasing after the Man in Black for a very long time. It is while chasing the Man in Black through the desert that Roland meets up with the boy Jake at an abandoned way station - and Jake appears to be from our world; how he got to Roland's world is a mystery. I won't ramble on about the plot - there are over 500 reviews here, plus long editorial reviews and I'm sure the plot is expressed well by someone else. I tend to throw out spoilers when I try, so I won't waste your time. I'll just say this: if you, like me, are unsure whether to go ahead and read these books - stop second-guessing yourself and go for it. Not only is the story entertaining, but it is also multi-layered. I have a feeling that reading it multiple times will result in multiple understanding - I've actually just finished reading it for the second time in less than a year, since I just got Wolves of the Calla (The Dark Tower, Book 5) and thought it best that I re-read the first four books before going on, so I can refresh my memory, and I can see things I've missed. I think people who aren't generally fans of Stephen King's works might still enjoy The Dark Tower series, because it is different than his usual fare in many ways, even though it has webs of other stories that occasionally wind through it. Definitely give this series a try.
A classic first entry in the dark tower series �The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed.� Never has a single phrase been as good at describing the crux of an entire novel. Stephen King�s first dark tower installment takes place in a desolate landscape of a world that mirrors our own. Roland, the last Gunslinger, chases after the man in black who holds the answers to get to the dark tower, a mission Roland has been on his entire adult life. As he travels around the vast desert hot on the tail of the man in black, Roland stumbles upon few sights along the way including the town of Tull, where he meets the sexually ravenous Alice and the god-worshipping Sylvia Pittston. It is after leaving Tull that Roland will meet the one person who will most help him fulfill his quest; the little boy Jake. Jake becomes the Gunslinger�s travel companion as they chase the man in black through this desolate world of sand, mountains and a whole lot of nothing. The Gunslinger is a terrific start to the series, a surreal adventure of boundaryless imagination. I get the impression much of the series is fantasy instead of King�s trademark horror but this first installment reads more like a western than anything else. The chapters where Roland rests in the town of Tull are the best part of the book, as King injects the town with truly bizarre and fascinating characters and a final showdon between Roland and the residents of Tull that results in a blaze of gunsmoke and firepower. This book is packed with action from start to finish but as a reader the utmost concentration must be kept at all times since The Gunslinger does not read in linear fashion; it is a book of many flashbacks, dreams and hallucinations. Amazingly, although the first installment of a series that contains several entries, The Gunslinger stands very well on its own as a singular tale. The ending is satisfying but of course many things are left unresolved such as two very fundamental questions; What is it that really lies within the dark tower? Who is Roland really and why is he doing this? After this excellent start, I�m looking very much forward to reading the other entries in the series. If the subsequent novels are anything like The Gunslinger, than I�m in for an amazing journey.
great! Jorma Knowles: "The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger" is, in my view, one of the best novels that the author, Stephen King, has written. The main character, Roland The Gunslinger, is complex and fascinating, and worthy of the series of books that he is featured in. The story of the book seems at first glance to be simple, but deeper into it you realize that it is much more complicated then you first thought. Roland is the last Gunslinger, a sort of knight who is charged with protecting the bleak and violent world that he lives in (it is referred to as having "moved on"), and his quest is simple: he is searching for a strange, distant thing called "The Dark Tower," something that has been seeked by the other Gunslingers before him. As he walks across a vast desert, he encounters various obstacles and other supernatural things (althought this NOT a horror novel) and finds a young boy from our universe named Jake, who actually died where he came from and was transported to the Gunslinger's world by an evil wizard who Roland is pursuing named simply "The Man In Black." (who is really a man from the Gunslinger's past named Walter) i wont tell you the end of this volume (the first) in the Dark Tower saga, but i promise that it will surprise you. Overall, the novel is well-written, with wonderful prose that is much different from Steve King's other work, and so utterly involving that you will find yourself caring for it's characters and it's story so much that you will jump right over to the next book in the series ( The Dark Tower: The Drawing of The Three) and not be able to put it (or any of the other's; the latest, the fourth, is coming out in November) down
A slow start but the story got better towards the end First - I am looking for an epic story along the lines of Erikson's Malazan Book of the Fallen God or Jordan's Wheel of Time. Erikson's books often took a couple of hundred pages before the story started to take off so I learned to be patient. This is the first book of Steven King that I have read so I am not accustomed to his writing style. The Gunslinger starts off slow and was initially hard to follow. I think was intentional given King was making the story somewhat a mystery. You need to read on in order to learn what is really going on. Towards the end of the book the story started to focus and I had an understanding of where the book was going - much more enjoyable. I have started the second book in the series and withhold final judgement until I have read through it. This book was not a wow as it simply set the stage for the rest of the series. I found the price high given the page count and how slow the story moved along
Impressive façade Potent, dreamlike, dark, but also... gratuitous, indulgent, offensive. There's no doubting King's ability to write evocative prose, to create a scene. There is, however, much reason to doubt his ability to write a coherent story: fabulous gloss, but not much going on underneath. Definitely nothing healthy. Don't get me wrong - I can `enjoy' (as King seems to want us to) an atrocity as much as the next ghoulish reader, but I want it to mean something - to hit me. Although he's ten times the writer Goodkind is, King is similarly too blithe about brutality for it to really be brutal. Contrast this with, for example, Banks' Use of Weapons and Card's Ender's Game: both include stingingly ugly incidents, but they actually sting because they're not hurled about so casually, and we are able to feel something for the victims and even the perpetrators. The gunslinger, however, can shoot everyone in a whole town without causing a fraction of the emotional reaction in the reader. The townsfolk are so obviously one-dimensional characters, foils - I mean, sure, the whole thing `looks' amazing, the consistent mood and scenery reminds me of the incredibly rich visuals of the TV series Carnivale(whoever directed this could definitely do `The Gunslinger' justice), but we're so detached from these dreamlike, no, not `characters', that's too strong a word for them - they're more like props: there's a piano in the saloon bar, there's a guy who'll get shot later. King loved the movie westerns a little too much - he hasn't merely recreated their mood, he's included the scaffolding holding up the shopfronts in the Hollywood back lot. This is more a tribute to (wonderful) artifice than an attempt at story. There's a weakness in making Roland's life automatically worth so much more than anyone else's. He becomes a little absurd - like Rambo standing invulnerable in a hail of bullets - because he's American and has his shirt off, and the others are just faceless gooks, bit players in a deliberately farcical melodrama. Death here really means nothing - they're just falling down like kids in a playground game. Again, King's skills as a presenter of scenes can fool you, or maybe that's all you might be asking of him, but this book really lacks substance - ironically in the same way that so many glib `happy ending' books (that you might be trying to escape from with King) lack substance. So many fantasy novels, for example, have no suspense because we can all see a mile off how the author is going to indulge his lead characters with wonderful powers that mean his evil nemesis never really had a chance, and that he'll get the girl. However, for King, the doom, instead of the victory, is just too easy - we know the gunslinger's going to be tortured, and going to bump into all sorts of abuse along the way, because that's the evil deus et machina that King is - but it's still lazily pulling God out of the box to ruin things with no attempt to make this square with a wider sensical plot. I mean, really, what's going on with the ridiculous `man in black' who, for all his pretensions of grandeur and mystery, `might as well go by the name Snidely Whiplash and twirl his handlebar moustache' (thankyou Tony Hines). There is no attempt to even vaguely explain his godlike powers - maybe he writes to the same ACME people that miraculously supplied Wile E. Coyote with anything he could imagine. How can we feel the tragedy we're supposed to with Jake's death when it's just a card being turned? Now the man in black telekinetically controls railway bridges - uh, right, great. And why is this demigod running from Roland? Why is he devoting himself entirely to torturing this man in these odd ways? Maybe I'm meant to be asking these questions to hook me into the story, but I really don't care about the answers: I don't trust King actually knew - he just ran with something that felt good to him. And while we're talking about ridiculous characters - did you pick that pretty much every woman we meet (Soobie, Allie, the Oracle, even Roland's mother) - are ruled by their sexual cravings. Yeah, that's pretty much what women are like, isn't it: they just want sex so bad that they let men order them about. I suppose this is a fantasy, but this aspect is particularly puerile. I reckon King would be better as part of a team: someone else comes up with a structure - he then comes into the picture by creating the ride. I could almost go along for the ride alone. My edition has the first couple of chapters of Volume 2, `The Prisoner', and, sure, King can cast a spell. He's particularly good at openings - creating a striking scene, and hinting at all sorts of intriguing mysteries that you'd like to have solved. However based on this volume I suspect he doesn't have anything substantial waiting for us - just more of this enigmatic darkness. But I don't think it's enough for me, impressive as it is. Give me some charm, some humour, some insight. Give me some reason for Roland having to be minutes away from death before he finally stumbles across a mystical door, or a way station, or whatever will be next - apart from the reason that it feels more dramatic that way. In the dream that is Mid-world anything can happen, and that's not a good thing if it's lazy and random. Well, not good for me anyway - but if you enjoy the vibe, man, of brutality in competently evoked settings, if you just want to escape the nauseating sentimentality of so many `feel-good' books and would like to feel bad for a change (in a detached, clearly contrived way from the comfort of your armchair) just for the heck of it, go ahead, pull up a chair.
Interesting read. I have both the original version of this tale and the newly edited version, and I like them both, but in all honesty, I don't believe that this was for me. I like Kings work, but his older stuff hasn't been hitting the mark with me like his new things. The story was so epic, and I enjoyed the way that it was told, and it reminded me of those old Clint Eastwood, spaghetti westerners that you would see on TCM. With the supernatural and the post apocalyptic elements. I'm happy that I had the audio version to accompany me, it was better heard than read. I wanted to read this before the movie comes out, so I would have a better leg to stand on. It just wasn't for me.
Two thumbs Waaay up!!! I hadn't read a novel by Stephen King in years. Though I would have considered myself his number one fan back in the early days of King's writings, I found myself let down more and more in later years. It seemed his novels got longer and longer, but in a more rambling way and I found myself skipping through parts in search of action. I finally had to give up and didn't read anything by King for probably ten years. Then I took a chance and picked up Under the Dome and though it was long, I found myself getting caught up in the story. I didn't love it as I did novels like--The Shining, The Stand or Carrie, and it did take me almost a month to finish it--but for the most part I found I enjoyed it. Then my daughter came home from college last week raving about this Gunslinger series. Her words--`You have GOT to read these! I LOVE them!' She even brought the first one with her, The Gunslinger, just to make sure I had a copy. I haven't seen my daughter get so excited about a book(s) since she read The Alien Chronicles, a saga by Deborah Chester back when she was ten years old. Surprise, surprise, it only took me two days to read The Gunslinger and my daughter (Kari :)) was right. I loved it! The old excitement I used to feel when picking up a new novel came roaring back. Was I just in the right frame of mind on this one? Can't say. But the story grabbed me right from page one and I had to force myself to put it down to take care of normal everyday business--like feeding the family, washing clothes etc. I had the old Stephen King "smile" back. Yah!! Roland is on a quest. He is chasing the man in black because he needs to learn what this stranger knows about a mysterious lone tower. Roland, or the gunslinger, as we start to think of him, will travel to the ends of the Earth, and any other dimensions he might run into, if he has to in order to reach this mysterious tower. He's not even certain what will happen when he finally gets there, only that he must. But at what cost? Jake is just a young boy the gunslinger finds in a deserted station in the desert and Roland knows he must take Jake with him. He grows close to the boy and enjoys his company. But Roland is haunted because he fears the time is coming when he will have to make a choice between catching up with the man in black, or saving Jake's life. Jake understands this as well and doesn't know if he can trust the gunslinger, a man he has grown to love in the short time they've been together. Roland is a hard man, but he also has a high sense of honor. I won't give anything away here, but the end of this novel had me chewing my nails down to the quick. It's been a long while since I've read anything I've enjoyed so much. I hope the others in this series will continue in the same way, because if they do, this series may very well drop my long-time King favorite, The Stand, down to second place.
What? This is Stephen King? Wow! You sure can tell that Stephen was young and eager to impress when he started this epic. He must of had a copy of every thesaurus ever printed at his disposal. And wore them out. I've never experienced a King novel that didn't keep me riveted until this one. The over use of his vocabulary skills and over description of events kept the story from progressing fast enough to keep me engaged. It almost forced me to set the book down for good. Then about 3/4 of the way through, things started to move along. It was like someone flipped a light switch. Now this is the Stephen King I like to read. By the end of this 1st book in the series I couldn't wait to get my hands on the second book in the series.
Fascinating and Compelling Of course, I've heard about these books for years, but I never considered myself much of a Stephen King reader. Sure, I read some collections of short stories, and I loved THE SHINING and THE STAND (movies), but the length of the novels always kept me at arm's length. But, when I was looking for my next audio book listen, someone recommended this series, so I decided to give the first book a try. THE DARK TOWER 1: THE GUNSLINGER by Stephen King (1982 (orig); Plume, June 24, 2003 (revised)) (This is a great summary of the book) From Amazon: In the first book of this brilliant series, Stephen King introduces readers to one of his most enigmatic heroes, Roland of Gilead, The Last Gunslinger. He is a haunting figure, a loner on a spellbinding journey into good and evil. In his desolate world, which frighteningly mirrors our own, Roland pursues The Man in Black, encounters an alluring woman named Alice, and begins a friendship with the Kid from Earth called Jake. Both grippingly realistic and eerily dreamlike, "The Gunslinger" leaves readers eagerly awaiting the next chapter. *** As for the book itself, I loved the simplicity of the world Stephen King created in this first novel. The struggle within the main character came through perfectly, and when the young boy Jake was introduced, I was hooked. I wanted to know how Jake's world tied in with Roland's and why Roland was so intent on his pursuit of the man in black. I also truly appreciated how few words were used to create this world and the characters. As far as the audio book goes, this was a great choice. The narration was great, and the story moved along at a nice clip for audio listening. I'd recommend this one for people curious about the series and those who, like me, are not die-hard Stephen King fans. The concept of the books is fascinating and compelling and left me wanting more of the same. Source of book: Purchased from Audible.com
Rather slow, but still fun In the intro, King even states that he looks back at this book and sees all of the things wrong with it. Of course, he was just a fledgling writer when he wrote this book and it's very unique and very Stephen King, but with the added cocktail of adolescent hungers that clearly drive this adventure. And it is an adventure. If you are a die-hard King fan, like me, it's probably a good idea to read this one, but it's not necessary to read the dark tower series in sequence. The later ones are much better.
Hero? Even though it is somewhat disjointed and occasionally some of the seams show (The Gunslinger was actually written and published as several short stories/novelettes in F&SF over a several year period), this is an excellent read. In basic format it is a classic 'quest' fantasy (as it should be, being based at least partially on the Childe Roland epic poem). Where it differs, startlingly so, is in its protagonist, a 'noble' knight remade in the image of an impossibly competent Old West gunslinger. Unlike much of the other King material I've read, Roland is almost totally defined as a character by his actions. His decision to remain in a town he knows is a trap (and leading to his slaughter of the entire town), his method of fighting in his 'coming of age' test, his sacrifice of Jake -- each item adds to the defined character, and it is not a very pretty picture that gets painted. At the same time, his very stubbornness and single-minded continuation towards his goal, regardless of obstacles, is a traditional picture of a hero type. The world that Roland inhabits and his 'man in black' quarry reminded me a lot of some of Zelazny's work (like Jack of Shadows and ...And Call Me Conrad) -- not quite our world, hazy, different, but with some recognizable sign-posts along the way that connects in some form with our mythos/archetypes. In some areas, it's a little too hazy, most especially in not giving the reader a roadmap to the 'rules' that govern his world - we go from everyday 'bullets work like normal' to 'raising the dead' to 'time warpage' without any real guide to what is possible or normal in this world. But the background history he gives Roland is just enough to whet the reader's appetite to look for more pieces to his puzzle world and the reason behind his quest. Overall, not a great work, as while it stands alone, it is obviously only a part of a much larger story, and the disjointedness is sometimes jarring. Still, this is a quite memorable and different story than the average King blockbuster.
he is everyman Roland is from time past and is the future. he seeks the man in black to bring to justice for the wrongs done to his father's memory. through the desert and dried, dead land he trudges alone. until he meets the boy and by doing so, catches the man in black who passes on messages to him that he doesn't remember but cannot forget. this series starts as if in a dream. neither good nor bad but unending. it captures you and holds you from the first word to the last dream. read on.......
It gets better and more interesting then it ends The first half of this book is hard to get through. At first, you are just getting small pieces of the bigger picture, which is okay if the there is enough plot to keep you interested, but there's not. The pacing through the entire book is off. It gets better and more interesting then it ends. However, I have started the second book and can't put it down. Like others have said, this is a decent gateway to better things. It's still unique in it's own right and leaves you wanting to continue the series.
Surreal Prologue Takes Patience But Worth the Effort I had picked up the original version of The Gunslinger about eight years ago, but never having been on aficionado of Westerns and not into Fantasy at that time, I just couldn't connect with the bleak and barren desert world King had created. I was completely baffled by this strange world and couldn't relate to the protagonist, Roland Deschain at all. I had drifted away from King for almost two decades following Pet Semitary but I cautiously made my way back to one of the beloved authors of my youth. With the excellent "11/22/1963", "Under The Dome" and the outstanding "Doctor Sleep", I have once again return to the fold of King's "constant readers." I felt a sense of duty to at least try The Dark Tower series because of the wonderful word of mouth recommendations from readers I trust and because the series is complete. I have vowed to not start any more multi-book series unless the series is complete. I am done with being terribly disappointed in series that I had invested years in only for the author to run the series in the ground or drag out a series for years. While still very surreal in prose and plot, I found this expanded version containing King's thoughtful and exemplary introduction, an easier journey. It helped that I read "The Talisman" and "Black House" back to back, these books were a great segue into the Dark Tower series. I was left wanting to know more. By the end of the book I began to view Roland the gunslinger as Roland the knight on a quest that might take his soul. I have already ordered the next book, The Drawing of Three, and plan to take a long, leisurely ride alongside Roland in his quest to find the Dark Tower. It takes a measure of patience to stay with Roland of Gilead, but by the end this book the pay off is well worth it and you want to stay with Roland to find out if he "will win through."
Basically, the man in black fled across the desert and the gunslinger followed... The plot of this, the first book of the Dark Tower series, is fairly simple and to-the-point. Roland, the Gunslinger, is after the mysterious Man in Black, who is responsible for much trouble and may have clues as to the whereabouts of the Dark Tower--which is tantamount to God's control room. I read this book at the recommendation of a friend, to determine if I might want to read the whole series. At first I wasn't too sure about it--seemed like a typical western, cowboy walks into a saloon type-a thing. Took about half-way through for me to really get interested (twas at the Waystation), where new characters are introduced and the story really gets into the sci-fi/multiverse concepts. By the slow mutants, I was sold and went straight on through the series. That being said, this book deserves a cover-to-cover reading before making your own decision, because while it starts in a genre that sci-fi/fantasy readers might grumble at, it ends firmly in safe and fascinating territory.
The start of the epic quest... The Dark Tower series. What can be said, except amazing story telling by King. He makes you feel as if you have known Roland and his ka-tet your whole life. All six (and I'm sure the seventh will be also) books are my all-time personal favorites. Once you start 'The Gunslinger' you will be hooked and will not stop reading until you finish the VI book: 'Song of Susannah', and then anxiously await the VII (last volume). I have read all of Stephen King's books (except for his two non-fiction works) and I feel that nothing even comes close to matching the Dark Tower series. Except for maybe 'The Talisman' or 'The Stand'... 'The Gunslinger' is not my favorite of the series, but it starts the whole epic saga off very well, and keeps you wanting more. If you are a fan of King and have not bothered to read the Dark Tower, you are making a big mistake. Start with this excellent book, and then before you know it, you will be finishing up 'Song of Susannah'.
Read Before The Movies!! I decided to start the Dark Tower series while I wait for Winds of Winter...as well as because of the upcoming movies. I really enjoyed this book, but it was a very quick read. I was a little confused at times as I am not used to the writing and terminology in this series, but it quickly grew on me and I went back and figured some stuff out. This first book seemed like it was pretty much character and setting development for the rest of the series. I can't wait to start #2!!!
It's a Slog To Get Through I read this because everybody I know keeps telling me to read the Dark Tower and that it's such an amazing story. Well, after reading it, I disagree. It's a slog to get through. Many parts of the story didn't seem to make any sense or go anywhere. There didn't seem to be any direction or purpose for anything. Nothing was explained. At the end, all I know is Roland wants to find the Dark Tower and that it's probably the home of the Devil. I guess I just "don't get it".
Go then, there are other worlds than these... The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed... If you HAVE NOT read this book, DO NOT follow. I repeat: DO NOT follow. Spoilers ahead! So, this one is very tricky. Why "tricky", you might ask. Well... many people don't know there are two fundamentally different versions of this book. I read it for the first time in 2004 or 2005, serbian translation of the "original" version. I knew about it back in 1993 already, when there were only two or three books in the series. But it just never attracted me (I lived in Germany back then, and the strange German titles for books didn't help either). So when I read it, it was hard. I was tempted to put it down. Until Jake Chambers was introduced into the story. Then I became hooked. Then I hated King and Roland for killing Jake. That original version doesn't sit well with many people. It's strange, the tone is much different than most other King-books. It's on the edge of boring when you read it the first time. So that's why King decided, back in 2003, to publish a revised version - one that would be more in the tone of the books that followed in the series, and one that would be clean of mistakes he made in the continuity when he wrote the later books. So when I first read The Gunslinger in English in 2012 (as a preparation to read The Wind Through the Keyhole), I read the revised version. And I liked it. It was a bit of a bummer that now all the lingo of the later books seeped into the first, "innocent" one, but it made sense in the big picture. Now I want to re-read the whole series (and hopefully, finally all the comics, too) and I took the original Gunslinger in English. And it's the story I remember reading the first time, with all its flaws, all the things young Stephen King (remember, he was 23 when he started the book, and he wrote it for 12 years. He never wrote anything that long) wanted to put into it to be cool, cryptic, myterious... And I still love it. I still hate King and Roland for letting Jake fall into that abyss near the end of the book (it doesn't matter what great things happen later in the series), but OH MY GOD the energy of the story, the big way ahead, the adventure... and with all the knowlegde of what awaits, it is just marvelous. All those connections to the Old Ones, the remnants (like the big railway station)... it makes me all want King to write stories about THAT time. Way, way before the Gunslinger and his time. But that probably won't ever happen. This book is the key to connecting to Roland, Jake, their relationship, The Man in black, who already here, though Young King didn't know yet, had all the charm of Randall Flagg, and as strange as it is, I can't imagine a better start for the series than this. And the flashbacks of Tull, Hax the cook, Roland's gunslinger test... it just has the magic only a young, but extremely talented writer (which is in itself rare) can produce. Yes, the following books have a different tone, which changes from book to book almost, but remember, this is a story which was started by a 23-year-old guy in 1970, and finished by a 56-year-old in 2003 (the last books were published in 2004). Now you try and write something like that without having differences in tone. I for one am grateful to sai King for having pushed us on this great journey. And just to show off what kind of a Tower-junkie I am - I got two DT-related tattoos. One of them is pretty big. Reviews for the rest of the series follows as I finish the books. Go then, there are other worlds than these.
This book is FANTASTIC, though the series... meh Soooo.... I, of course, finished the entire series, cuz that's how I roll, but I had some major issues with the way King went with some stuff in the last three books. I still read them and, overall, enjoyed them but they were not without fault and I actually wanted to write him a nasty letter ;) I cannot in good conscience recommend the series to my pickier of friends, BUT I have no regrets for having read it. That all being said, Book 1: The Gunslinger was my favorite out of all seven books (book 3 ran a close second). If King had stuck with this style in the first book I would have been pleased. Also, while reading this book I, no kidding, said to myself: "This may end up being the greatest series I've ever read." THE POTENTIAL WAS THERE but King beefed it later on (he has an "ending" problem). The last three books were rushed and it showed. It felt like he just wanted to finish. I know this series is not his bread and butter... he has his hands in a lot of pots... but as a fantasy fan, I felt ripped off. I think the other fantasy series that I have loved were created by authors who made those series their life's passion and didn't have a lot else going on, so that could be the issue here. But King claims to be a fantasy reader himself, so he should know better. We take this stuff real serious, and he should have too. For shame, Steven King, for shame.
A Great Start "The Gunslinger" is the first book in Stephen King's epic fantasy series, titled "The Dark Tower." This book is very, very different from the fantasy that you can pick up in bookstores or purchase at Amazon. This epic has a very different feel to it when you are reading the book. I would say that this book is a western type of fantasy, with particular emphasis on the western part. Most of the book takes place in the desert and villages in it, and this will give the feel that distinguishes this book from others. Stephen King is a master of the English language and his words paint a clear image in your mind. The book starts off teaching you about the gunslinger, who we later learn is named Roland, is chasing the Man in Black. The book is like a mystery in a way as as the book progresses you learn about the gunslinger's motives and we eventually learn his real obsession. Roland stops at a village and falls in love with a woman. In this part of the story King portrays a romance between the gunslinger and his girlfriend. Later on in the book Roland the Gunslinger meets up with the child Jake, and Jake continues with Roland on his quest to find the Man in Black. At the end of the novel Roland will have to make a hard choice concerning Jake and the Man in Black. The story has a good set up but does come across a bit slow throughout the novel. Stephen King originally wrote "The Gunslinger" as five different short stories, and they are all published here as one novel. Each part of the book can be appreciated as a story in itself or as a part of the whole fantasy epic. On another note, King's idea for this book came from Robert Browning's epic poem, "Childe Roland." Roland the Gunslinger is a man obsessed with finding the Man in Black. The last part of the story is defintely the best as you learn lots about why Roland has been following the Man in Black. We learn how Roland is set out to find the Dark Tower, which is supposed to hold a room that is basically the control room of all the universes. King is a greatly talented author and it shows here. King brought an inventive fantasy story and put in many different flavors so this book will appeal to a wide group of readers. As curious as I am to find out more about Roland's quest, I am going to hold off reading the books until the next two books of the series are published, probably next year, so I won't I will be able to read most of the series all at once. This is a masterpiece that shouldn't be passed up. Happy Reading!
The Gunslinger Part of The Dark Tower Series by Stephen King. Highly Recommended!!!!!!! Too bad I could not give 10 stars. #1 The Gunslinger - Introduction to the last Gunslinger, Roland. This book was wonderful. It introduces you to some of the characters of the series and gives you the Gunslinger's quest. #2 - The Drawing of the Three - Roland pulls future Gunslingers, Jake, Eddie, and Suzannah from our world over to his. I really enjoyed how this was done. The characters are very likeable (especially OY) #3 - The Wastelands - The Gunslingers make continue on their way. Blaine really is a pain. #4 - Wizard and Glass - Roland tells them the story of Susan, The girl at the window. A very sad thing that happened to him in childhood. A beautiful story. #5 - Wolves of the Calla - The gunslingers help a town that is about to have their children taken. Jake makes a friend his own age. A character from another King book is met. This book was well put together. #6 - Song of Suzannah - This one tells of something that Suzannah is going through. #7 - The Dark Tower - The quest is finally over. The tower is reached. But who will make it there? Believe it or not this book made me cry. #* - The Wind Through the Keyhole - This story takes place between some of the other books. It is Roland and his gang taking refuge from a storm and Roland telling stories to pass the time. The stories are beautifully written. All of the stories in this series are exceptional. I love how they flow together. It really does seem like one continuous book.
Stephen King Convert As a serious scholar of English literature, I had often pooh-poohed King as a novelist. Even the biggest of fans has to admit that his popular fiction, although certainly riveting as page turners, could hardly rate as first class. However, after reading The Gunslinger I hold the man in high esteem as a writer. Using the poem, Childe Roland by Robert Browning as a touchstone, King has created a world that is compelling and literarily sound. His use of language and symbolism is deft. I think when all the points are tallied, King will be remembered as a literary giant. If you are unsure about his writing ability then give his Dark Tower series a chance.
Challenging start to an amazing series The Gunslinger is the opening book in Stephen King's amazing The Dark Tower series. This book is excellent but I found it very challenging to read the first time through. The first fifth of the book (the section called "The Gunslinger") is very surreal and dream like. There are a lot of things that just pop up and seem kind of hazy and hard to latch onto. There is a very dark and bleak tone and I remember the first time through thinking "man, am I signing up for 7 books of this?" Fortunately The Gunslinger picks up a lot after the first section and becomes easier to follow as it goes on. Stick with it! This book is written with the style of throwing you into a complex world with its own vocabulary and customs without explaining very much directly. While this helps make the world feel "lived in", it is pretty disorienting at first. I've just finished my first re-reading of The Gunslinger after reading the entire Dark Tower series and I found I enjoyed this book much more after knowing more context. Things immediately make more sense, you just need context from the rest of the series. This is definitely intentional (and pretty brilliant) on Stephen King's part. Reading this book a second time after you've gone through the journey once is significantly different, which ties into some of the larger themes of the series - Ka is a wheel after all. This book is the gateway to some of the very best stories I've ever read. Books 2-4 of the Dark Tower are some of my all time favorites and the ending was one of the most visceral reading experiences I've ever had. Better yet, reading this series changes how you look at every other book Stephen King has written. This is a series that sticks with me on the level of Lord of the Rings or A Song of Ice And Fire, I can't give a better review than that.
I didn't expect this! I am an avid Stephen King fan but I always avoided reading this book since it came out in the 80's...I love King's horror books and have read most of them since the late 70's...recently, I read some non-horror King books that were pretty good (11/22/63) so I decided to revisit this series and see if I could get into it this time...I am going to say something that I thought I would never say but this book is probably the best book I have ever read by Stephen King...it completely changes everything I ever thought about him as a writer...I read it again and again...it completely blew my mind. There are very few books which are as perfectly constructed as this one. The way this first (in a series of 7) book ends is remarkable. There is still horror and science fiction in this but the philosophical undertones are dramatic, and for me, mostly unexplored themes from other books by King. This is quite the achievement. I don't know if other King fans will agree or not, but to me, this holds true. The beginning is a little disjointed and it takes a bit for you to get into the book but if you have the patience, you will be rewarded at the end. You will find yourself going back and reading the beginning again with a new understanding. Once you get to the second part of the book, you will not stop reading it. I can only look forward to what the future holds in store for Roland and his adventures in this post-apocalyptic world, to figure out who and what the man in black is. It's a perfect beginning to the gunslinger's quest.
Thought was okay - good enough that I will get the 2nd in the ... Heard of this book and when saw author had done revision decided to check out. Thought was okay - good enough that I will get the 2nd in the series from library for free and decide if continue with the series or not. Interesting 'gunslinger' in a future world concept.
The Dark Tower starts here! Hey, it's Stephen King! Of course it;s a lotta things, but this revision is done a little better than the original, still a great read, but of course there are SIX more to read after this!! Will read them all again... Great tie-ins to other King books!
A new Stephen King fan! I don't really care for the "horror" genre so never read any books from Stephen King. A friend convinced me to try The Dark Tower series and although the first book was a bit light on the action the writing was excellent and I can see how King is so popular. I've been told that the next books are more action-oriented and I've already purchased the next book.
Confusing Flashbacks and Dated Writing Makes This a Slow Start I did this all wrong. I'm travelling in reverse down the Stephen King highway. I started with Joyland, then On Writing, then 11/22/63, and then Under the Dome, and I'm just now reading his older works. And there's a noticeable difference. Other King fans have had the benefit of growing up, watching King define his writing prowess. From where I stand, I have an opportunity to peer through the looking glass and compare the King of yesteryear to the author he is today. And that's a good thing. That's what fuels my desire and whets my appetite more. The Gunslinger is an example of a creative genius trying too hard. As his preamble states, King tried to combine The Lord of the Rings with a Sergio Leone western. And you know what? For the most part he pulled it off. Here, in just the beginning of a seven novel journey, I can see the making of a brilliantly crafted universe packed with love, sacrifice, heroism, action, and every other clichéd word that's come out of a deep-voiced trailer narrative. What falls apart--again, in King's own admittance--is a writing that obfuscates the view. With the defunct blowhard narrative, the obsessively used adverbs, and the broken apart flashbacks, the reader is left with a blurred masterpiece. What could have been, and what King promises later is true, is a vivid, amazing story. I'm just disappointed I need to wait until a later book for this to transpire. The youthfulness of King's writing often makes its appearance throughout the Gunslinger. We're witness to whatever writing workshop advice King received. I'm sure someone told him all the great writers have a story within a story. I'm also assuming due to the frequency of its use, he newly learned the word palaver. The time spent in King's alternate universe was not a waste. I appreciated the journey. There was enough action to move me forward and enough foreshadowing to yearn for more. Again, I just wish the flashbacks were more defined and the narrative more clear.
Great Beginning To An Incredible Fantasy Epic! This is the first in Stephen King's Dark Tower series and right away it pulls the reader into the desolate landscape of an Alter-Earth, where similarities between our world are noted and the differences are savored (and cringed at). Comparable to Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings series (although definitely intended for a much older and mature audience)this involves one man's quest for a Dark Tower (which presumably could save his dying world), a man that is a cross between a knight and an American West gunfighter (hence the title). In this he is following a "man in black" who may have answers he so desperately needs. This is entertaining reading at its best, adventure, intrigue, a must for any fan of Stephen King. I'm not that big of a fantasy novel fan but this book and it's sequels are excellent motivators to peruse that genre. Bottom line, if you're looking for some fun while reading check this book out. If you do you'll not only finish this book but you'll find yourself going right for the next one, until you find yourself waiting (rather patiently I might add) for Mr. King to put out another one of these tightly woven, highly interesting stories!
Brilliant prose, bad story, worse philosphy and abysmal theology. I read the first installment of the series because of the upcoming movie. The fact that the author explains himself in the introduction should be a spoiler that the book itself can not carry its own, despite the soaring prose. Why do professional storytellers try to be amateur philosophers or theologians? The answer is probably that we all are, the difference between one amateur philosopher and the other is that one can write prose (or songs) and therefore has an audience while the other can not and therefore does not. The Gunslinger is a flat nonstory with some highlights of inconsequential violence-porn and senseless demon-sex that ends in an exposition dump of amateur ontology that leaves you glad that you do not need to read the next book in the installment. All this told in beautiful prose.
It's better this time! Read this series years ago, but in coming back to it as a much older person, I find a certain richness in the experience of time, with the world " moving on." Amidst all the chaos of tale and sorcery, oracles and the like, we find the fundamental character of the man is what leads him forward on his journey. I know what comes next, but at the same time, I'm anxious to rediscover it through King's eyes. Wonderful reading!
Best of the first three in the series! I have read the first three books in the series and this is by far the best of them. The narration moves along at a fair pace and it isn't drawn out. A few friends have told me that they didn't like the first book, but I felt just the opposite. I will admit that this book is different from the other two books that follow it in its style, length, and narration.
Roland's journey to the Dark Tower This is a great read. Matter of fact the whole series of the Dark Tower is a GREAT read. Really hard to put the book down once you start. This is about Roland and his journey to the Dark Tower. I liked it so much that I have the whole series. Now I am waiting to see if a movie is made regarding this story.
OK as one-seventh of a series, but not a great stand-alone novel I love King's vocabulary and style, and have read several other of his novels. I've heard enough about the Dark Tower series that I wanted to bite the bullet; take the plunge, whatever trite metaphor you like. I'm not quite mid-way through the 7-book series yet, so I'm withholding judgement on the magnum opus, but as a *stand alone* novel, this book is just OK. If you plan on reading the series, I guess you have to read them all, but if you're only looking for one book to read, I don't recommend this one; when you're finished, you won't feel satisfied or complete.
Strong Ending Things are slow at first. The author's introduction to this edition, On Being Nineteen (and a few other things), was what kept me going. Definitely a good read and I look forward to the next book. (What a rich nineteen year old mind to have started such a story; capturing such a world on paper. And to have the ability to draw this 43 year old mind into that world . . . what a gift.)
Intriguing and difficult approach to the epic myth genre I'm terribly intrigued by this story. I don't know who it was that suggested I pick it up and read it, but after reading Tolkien's famous works of the One Ring, I thought I'd give this epic tale a try. The difficulty in it is that there is a whole new sense of world and mythology behind it. Nothing actually new (western style gunslingers, Arthurian social castes, epic scale of earth, time and space) but the way King presents it, it takes a long time to understand what is going on. Only by the time I was finishing the story did I really start to feel comfortable with the timeline, character, and possible future of the story. Also, he's a brilliant writer, and honestly, I had difficult time reading it because he uses soo much vocabulary that I wasn't familiar with. I'm glad I had to look up words and be challenged to think more about what I was reading, but it took me longer to read it because of that. I'm just now reading the 2nd book in the series now with a bit more ease.
Meh, seems like it's written for teens. I had heard a lot of hype about these books being amazing. I'm not impressed with the first one. I have been told I have to make it to book three before the story gets really good. I don't think I'll be reading the rest.
Great Start To A Series I've been looking for a new series to get into for some time and overheard some of my co-workers discussing The Dark Tower series. Needless to say, this is not a new series by any means, but one that is getting popular again, due to the newest book being released early this week. The tale of the story is genius and incorporates many different themes, including western and parallel universe. There are also tons of metaphors which really make you think. Overall, it is a quick read and definitely makes you want to read the next!
King Has Done It Again! King is the master of dark! Compelling and fulfilling, the reader is drawn into a new fantasy world full of mystery and suspense. I only put it down when I absolutely had to! I'm a first time reader and I'm already mid-way through book two! Kudos to King!
great series.. writer... not happy with you Stephen......... This dark tower series is I think his greatest work. It has ket (lol) me with him since 1982 but at times made me not buy anything else he wrote. Reason.... Time.... At the end of book 3 he promised to have another out by Christmas of 1982... when did it finally come out? A decade later... It took him over 20 years to finish the series and it was infuriating to have to wait for him to get in the mood to finish it. The series itself however.... I loved it....
An absolute must The Dark Tower series is among the best writing you will find. It's Stephen King, so the story can be a bit weird - something that usually keeps me away from books like this - but he's such a master with the English language that he'll get you past that aversion in a hurry. The first seventeen pages of this book are some of my favorite bits of writing in history.
Wonderful world-building, characters, and setting. A quick, enjoyable entry into the series. The Dark Tower 1: The Gunslinger was not what I expected based on the intro by King, where he essentially credited his need to write this book as coming from the Lord of the Rings series. That isn't to say I didn't like the book - quite to the contrary, I love the world he has created. King doesn't mind throwing you into the deep end a bit, and then giving you enough details and understanding of the "way things are" to get back to dry ground. The pacing is excellent, the characters well-developed, and the setting is palpable. You feel the dryness of the world, the methodical way the gunslinger moves through it after his quarry, and realness of the dangers of the journey. Ahead of it's time as a sort of mash-up of post-apocalyptic fiction and the fantasy genre that Sanderson, Rothfuss, and Martin are making more rich every day. Don't stop with Book 1: it gains speed and breadth when you move down the beach to Book 2...
Disappointment I've never read Stephen King before, though friends swear by him... I prefer fantasy. When I read reviews that he had written The Gunslinger as his first attempt at fantasy, I thought it was probably a safer bet than an unknown writer (I've read some pretty bad stuff, but knew it was a toss up). This was SO not my taste! Give me Tolkien or Sanderson or Jordan any day...
First in the series BUT... I've read this book many times before, but this is new to my kindle. I thought something felt different, almost as if it were a different book. Then I notices the revised and updated throughout notice. I think I'll continue the series on my kindle - good part is now there are color pictures like in the book - but I may not read them all again if the next one is "revised and updated throughout" It's like a cheeseburger without cheese.
Not sure how to say this..... Actually I thought it was a little too disjointed. I had a hard time following the story and trying to figure it out. I even found myself going back to try to make sense out of events. I almost didn't finish it but thats not my style. I am going to read the next one as the reviews seem to be more favorable. I will give it a try as my goal is to read the whole series. I am a Stephen King fan so I am confident I won't be disappointed.
Size and Time And so one cycle ends and another begins. I read this when it first came out and failed to grasp the biblical aspect of creation. Now a little older and hopefully wiser the story will have a whole new meaning for me. I am looking forward to the drawing of the three.
Why'd you do it Stephen? I am so annoyed that I bought this book. I am a HUGE fan of the Dark Tower series and I can't wait for the rest of the series to be published. I just don't see the need for anyone who has already read the original version to read this one. The meeting with the man in black was altered too much and he took out some of its better lines. Example: "Do I know you?" was changed to "Will I win?" There are a few other unnecessary alterations that I can't mention because they would be spoilers. I think that the original version is perfect by itself and if you can find a copy of it, please read it instead of this version. I gave this version of the book 3 stars because I still love the story to no end, but I had to count off for the annoyance factor. I'd give the original 5 stars.
Great Books! I just discovered the series, I love it. I'm glad I wasn't into it before now - waiting between installments would have made me crazy! I didn't have the problem some folks did with getting into The Gunslinger - for me it was not a difficult read. However, for those who felt that it was ploddy, stick with it because it does set up the story for the rest of the series.
Excellent! I can't believe it took me this long to start The Dark Towers series but I'm sure glad I did! I love getting lost in King's stories no matter what the genre. Gunslinger is not something I ever would have started had it been done by another author but I'll read anything by Stephen King so I jumped in and found myself a new series. The man is a genius!
Why did it take me so long? My son has been after me for years to read this series. I started it once a long, long time ago, and I just couldn't get into it. After seeing his excitement when the final book was published, I decided to try again. After downloading the revised book to my kindle, I read the introductory sections be Stephen King, and dove in. I was unable to put the books down this time. I just finished the series. This has to be one of the best series I have ever read! For all of you fans who haven't read this series, try it again and you won't be disappointed. It really is a fantastic series, so far at least.
Book One is ponderous and needlessly dense. This is the FIRST book I have ever read by Mr. King. It was suggested to me....or I should say the series was suggested to me by my next door neighbor. He warned me that the first book was going to require some effort and he was spot on. After reading half of it I wondered to myself what was my neighbor seeing in this book? I stuck with it since the series has so many positive reviews. I give this book only two stars BUT I give the series 10 stars. If you can plod through the first book and often confusing language etc... you will be pleased to find that book two and three will hook you. I am now half way through book three and I spend a little time each day wondering just what is going to happen next to Roland, Eddie, and Susanah. Will Jake make another appearance So I suppose in some ways I am being unfair to book one. It did hook me. BUT without the prodding of my neighbor to keep at it I would have stopped at 75% of book one. If you like mind bending, thought provoking, time bending, and question asking....you will like this series and I give it a HIGH score. BUT just be aware that while Book one is important to understand what follows it is not indicative of the series. The books get better and better. Or is it that Mr. King has drawn me into his web and I can't escape..... He seems a little sneaky so I would not put it past him! Just kidding. Thanks Mr. King. A great series that I will be sad to read the last one... because then I might understand what the heck is going on! :) :)
SO GOOD! Even better the second time around! I read the Dark Tower series about 7 years ago, and I almost cried when I finished. Not because of how the journey ends for Roland and his ka-tet (though that's a good reason), but because I finished probably THE BEST series of fiction, with probably the BEST cast of characters, and hands down the greatest main character ever created by any author ever in modern fiction, Roland Deschain. And finishing Roland's story finally, I found that I missed him, Jake, Eddie, Susannah, and Oi. They had been part of my life so long, that it was like losing my best friends. Recently I convinced my wife to read the Gunslinger to see if she would get hooked like I did. Well she didn't read it fast enough so I took over and I happy to see Roland my old friend once again. And of course I am again obsessed with finding the Dark Tower, almost as much as Roland. Now to see more old friends as I start book two.
Good Job By Stephen King Stephen Kind does a great job of using the quest/pursuit theme to weave a great story. He describes the world the gunslinger is not quite a dystopian one, but simply his world "moved on". The pursuit of the "man in black" was not over-done. The final conversation between the gunslinger and the "man in black" sets the tone for the other books in this series. A great read.
Good so I bought the second... The intro to the series, not what I had expected but that didn't stop me from reading it all the way through and buying the next one! It's a lot of character development which is needed when you begin the second. It's a quick read at only about 250 pages but I enjoyed it.
The Begining to A Great Book The Gunslinger is one very good book. I really like the characters here because I really believe this is a story you will not be able to put down. Many people dont have time to read but when you pick this book up you will not be able to put it down. Make sure you have extra time on your hands or else youll become glued to the book.
Loved it! I would consider myself Stephen King's #1 fan, but there are probably thousands that would say the same. I had to buy this again since my original copy was loaned out and not returned. I am in the process of finishing the entire DT series. Never dissapointed with his books.
I waited a LONG Time When The Gunslinger first appeared I decided that I didn't want to get stuck in the middle of a series, Then I started the Wheel of Time.. but that's another story. I did stick to this one however without fully understanding that I'd be waiting 20 years to read this thing. Now it's finished though and I've just finished the first book in the series. Was it worth the wait? Damn right it was! Apart from having what I think is the most intriguing opening line in literary history - my own admittedly limited view probably - the world here is so odd that it might have been off-putting except that it's also so well imagined. the problem with being a fantasy fan is that I've been relegated to reading fantasy NOVELS, which is all very well and good except that everyone (literally everyone) in that genre seems to just want to retell Lord of the Rings. Fantasy is the genre that allows you to create a world as crazy as you want without explaining yourself in the slightest and yet the authors in this most extraordinary of genres just tell the same story. Part of what I like about this book has to do with the fact that King doesn't explain himself. Rather, King tells us about the world we are in through the actions of the main protagonist Roland, if Roland is afraid of something then we should be afraid of it. An unexpected side effect of this kind of storytelling is that we come to trust Roland which might be awkward since Roland commits many acts which are completely and utterly reprehensible. So yes, I liked it, the characters have depth, the World is, let's say unorthadox and the ending is crazy. It doesn't hurt that King's metaphysics in this world tend to match up with mine quite a bit. All that and I don't have to wait years for the sequel! HA!
The Gunslinger The first instalment of Stephen King's fantasy series is unashamedly inspired by that other fantastic series, "The Lord of the Rings". King made no attempt to hide this and refers to it in each of his surprisingly-interesting forwards, but the thought of reading something so obviously "inspired" put me off. It was only after the release of the final book in the series I was persuaded to pick up "Gunslinger", and was appalled at how brilliant it was. It's easy for people to say King's off his game, but he wasn't then and he isn't now - the final book, released only recently, is testament to this. "Gunslinger" is arguably everything that Stephen King isn't: beautiful, poetic, and not really horror. Technically it's fantasy, post-apocalyptic fantasy, and on top of that it's a Western of sorts. It's a glaring divergence from King's usual style, but what appalled me was that it was good. Very, very good, and despite the assumption that King's unfamiliarity with the genre would prove to be the novel's downfall, it is also full of everything that King is wonderful at: suspense, mystery, and very real characters. A review column isn't the place for a synopsis, so I'll keep it brief. This book has one real character and that's the mysterious hero, the eponymous gunslinger who is a throwback from a bygone age that existed before the world "moved on". The brevity of the novel lends itself to this kind of storytelling, in which we follow a single character in a series of events, a tale told in a surreal, rippling narrative that is like looking through water at an alternate world. The other novels don't keep up this dreamlike form of storytelling, which makes "Gunslinger" all the more precious. If you like King, you'll love this, regardless of the change in genre. If you pick this up and hate it, you'll still come away with a fresh idea on what novels are all about, reminded why people write. Simple story. Complex characters. You don't have to read the others if you don't like it, but if you want a fresh piece of fiction from an established super-writer, then for God's sake try "Gunslinger"!
The beginning of an amazing series! The Dark Tower is probably my favorite series and if you are to follow what King says and see it as a whole novel, then it's my favorite novel. I don't really see it as a whole novel in the same way that I don't see Lord of the Rings as a whole novel. As in both, there are books in the collection that are much better than others. The Gunslinger is the beginning. It's Star Wars before it was Episode IV: A New Hope. It's flawed, the effects are out of date, the characters not completely fully-realized, the narrative a little stilted sometimes, the dialogue a little clunky, but all in all, the beginning of a great saga. Even with the new revised edition, the Gunslinger has its flaws. I agree with King that he didn't find his voice until Drawing of the Three. But Gunslinger is still good. It's still very, very good! We meet Roland and we don't like him for most of the book. We meet Jake and we love him. We cry for him. We are introduced to a world that "has moved on." It's a wasteland of a world that doesn't even hint of the wonders to come (monorails, giant robotic animals, glass castles, fields of roses, and the Tower itself). This book sets the stage, introduces some of the characters, and with the revising, hints at the things to come. In the whole series, it's the weakest of them all. Nothing can ever change that. It's the nature of the tale, the setup for the story to come. The Gunslinger is like a long prologue. It's what you have to get through to get to the meat! But it's worth it. It's good to finish the book, close it's covers, and leap into Drawing of the Three. Because, trust me, that's when it gets going. That's when the story starts to cook! The Dark Tower is the greatest fantasy collection of our times. Like those before (LOTR, Chronicles of Narnia, Oz books) it is about right and wrong, what makes us humans, love, wonderment, evil of the utmost, living our lives to the fullest, and never ever forgetting the faces of our father. It's about Ka.
Among the Greats The Gunslinger by Stephen King was a surprise for me. I haven't really read any King since junior high school; I kind of came to see him as too mainstream for me early on. This was in no way based on his merit as a writer - I was just a know-it-all kid who scorned all that was popular. That being said, I was blown away by the scope of this first volume of the Dark Tower series. It is right up there among Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter (and Stephen King would be honored by the comparison, I know). In particular, I loved the way that the language of the Gunslinger was just oddly different enough from our own to cause the reader to know definitively that this knight of Gilead was related to us in some distant way. An example of this is, "I cry your pardon." It's enough like "beg your pardon" to understand its purpose, but just off enough to signal alienation from our own society. The Gunslinger's Mid-World is reminiscent of Tolkien's Middle Earth in that each is a heretofore unknown piece of human history. Unlike Middle Earth, which is our distant past, Mid-World is in our distant future, as evidenced by this exchange between Walter and the Gunslinger: "Gunslinger, our many-times-great grandfathers conquered the-disease-which-rots, which they called cancer, almost conquered aging, walked on the moon." By the Roland's time, however, the world has moved on. He cannot even believe that Walter speaks the truth. The story of the Gunslinger follows Roland across the desert in his chase of the Man in Black. As he crosses, he meets several different odd characters who help and hinder him on his quest, the most memorable of which is a doomed young boy named Jake from our own world. In case it isn't yet evident, I highly recommend the Dark Tower series to any person with the slightest inclination to read science-fiction. The Gunslinger is probably the most difficult of the series to read, just because King doesn't spoon-feed anything to the reader. Hold on and let him take you along this epic journey.
A Good Beginning. Let's face it: King is just too good an author, has too much going on, to simply stick to writing novels his whole career. I'm not saying that his stand-alone novels aren't good, far from it,(even though I've only read two) but it is even better for King to do something bigger - in a word, a masterpiece. These Dark Tower Dark books appear to be just that. I guess, at the core of the story, its a fantasy. It has all the elements - a quest, final battle approaching, a great civilization now gone to ruin, etc... But I'm sure this is unlike any fantasy that you've ever read. It's got a definite western setting, but to classify it as a western would probably be just as bad as the other. I'd say its a fantasy/western, with smatterings of science fiction and horror as well. But, when it really boils down to it, its an epic. It definately has some strangness, but its strange in a good way. There's something extremely evocative and intriguing about the whole setting that makes me eager to finish the tale. The book opens with the gunslinger, Roland of Gilead, chasing the man in black across the desert in a world that has "moved on." The author is intentionally vague about what that phrase means, as well as who the gunslinger is and what his purpose is. More will be revealed throughout the book, in pieces, but only a little, because there'e six more books to go. Since it starts off this way, it may take a little getting into, because at first all you know is that this guy is chasing another guy, but it definately gets enjoyable pretty soon. There are flashbacks throughout the book, but they don't slow the plot down. Part of the beauty of the story is discovering all the back history piece by piece. This book really was quite enthralling. The ending will definately throw you for a loop; it gives a hint of just how big the whole story is, but at the same time I found it very anticlamatic, and when the story ended I was left with a sort of emptiness that I did not like. But, aside from the very beginning and very end, this book was quite good. Now, on to Round Two...
Standin' on tha corner straight slingin' guns "The Man in Black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed." Never before has a more succint-cum-intrigue introductory line been printed. (not since the opener to Ray Bradbury's Farenheit 451 that is: "It was a pleasure to burn.") The Gunslinger is one of the most romantic (think Hemmingway, Nelson Algren) novels of all time. Our hero is the last of the Mohicans, so to speak, in a land where shi--err--stuff has happend and the world has moved on. Desolate disaster and death lies behind every town's facade and there is one man who can possibly put an end to the wrong; a true man that can but try: the gunslinger. He escapades across desserts and mountains in search of the Dark Tower--the eiffel that holds the worlds (Earth, his world, and the existing others) together. Along the way he meets a boy named Jake. Jake is a piece of the puzzle that the gunslinger must solve, a pawn to the Dark Man's chess game. It is a blood-sworn journey the gunslinger is on. His past, his training, and lost lovers are stops along the way. The only solution he knows lies in his Sandalwood grip pistols crisscrossing his midsection. It is a sad tale, but a very palatable one if you reflect on how our world too has moved on. If you love King or hate him, let The Gunslinger set the record straight. It is the first in a (currently unfinished) Dark Tower series and is like nothing King has ever pinned. It is a dark novel which exists in sour dreams. The best, the best King has done. It's straight from the hip of his drug-addled past (a fact that is evident in the novel). This book is one that has been overlooked by movies, universities, demagogues and egotists, but mark my words: The Gunslinger will emerge in the 21st century as a powerful novel, as evident and poignent in society as Romeo & Juliet; once dissected, will be served in High School along with sloppy joes, John Steinbeck.

The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed. I've just got to say, this has to be the best opening sentence to a book EVER written. And it wasn't just a great book, but a wonderful series as well. This is the first book of the Dark Tower Series. This is an introduction of two of the main characters of the series... if not the two main characters. Roland (The Gunslinger), who is definitely the main character, later on meets and befriends Jake along his travels as he pursues the man in black. In fact, Jake becomes more of a son to Roland than a friend. There were two versions of this book. The first version was one of the first books ever written by Stephen King and dealt with the time line of this story with slight glimpses of Roland's past. This new version was released before the series was finished and some of the story was re-written while adding several flashbacks to help the reader learn and understand Roland better. I have read them both and I think if you are going to go the distance with this series the background story is helpful. If you are only going to read one version, make it the latter one. The main object of Roland's desire is The Dark Tower. He does not know why he needs to go there only that it is his destiny (or ka, as this and subsequent books call it) to do so as told by a pink orb he acquired before the events of this book. It is not only his quest to find the Dark Tower but to understand its purpose as well. This book sets up nearly all of the events of the future books of this series. In the end, Roland is tested. Is he willing to give up everything for this quest? Is he willing to go the distance even if he must sacrifice the objects he holds most dear in his life? A note on the series: I began reading this series in junior high school but became disheartened with the cliffhanger ending of the third book and the long delay until it was resolved in the fourth book (6 Looooooong YEARS!). I vowed to not read this series until it was completed. Well, ladies and gentlemen, the series has been completed and resolved. Count yourselves lucky that you did not have to wait 17 years for the conclusion as I did (I restarted it after book seven was announced). It is a long ride for the dark tower is far away and there is much to be done before Roland reaches it. Is it worth the journey? Oh yes, this is one of the best series ever written. It is hard to categorize this series, however. My local library has it listed under Science Fiction. But there are bits of horror, bits of western lore, bit of fantasy, and bits of pure drama. So if you like any of these categories, there is something for you to be found in this series.
unlike any other King I've read This is very different from any other King that I've read so far. It's like a high fantasy, spaghetti-western, fever dream. The writing seems sparse upon reading, but the surreal landscape soon becomes memorable and haunting. I'll admit there were times when I wasn't even sure what I'd just read, it gets pretty strange at times. But by the end I was intrigued enough to have purchased the second volume. My hope is that the weirdness ends up being metaphorical and not simply weirdness for weirdness' sake.
At times hard to read, but overall an intriguing ... At times hard to read, but overall an intriguing book that sets the reader up for the rest of the series. I'll definitely keep reading the books- already started the Drawing of the Three and I'm hooked.
In fact I enjoyed the book so much I bought the next 4 ... Tentatively purchased this book as I am a big fan of Stephen King but was unsure of this epic of story of his. I got to say I had much difficultly putting this book down. In fact I enjoyed the book so much I bought the next 4 books on my Kindle. I am now cruising through the second book and would recommend this book (and this series) to anyone who enjoys Stephen King and tales to the scale of Lord of the Rings.
I like to refer to this series as "the best trip ... I've read this series twice now and am about to begin on my third journey. I like to refer to this series as "the best trip you've ever been on without the need for drugs". It is THAT good. I love how King intertwines real life events over time into his stories and in this storyline, in particular, it's done masterfully well.
17 year old wrote this?!?!?!? What has always amazed me about this series is that this first book was the first book that Stephen King ever wrote when he was 17. He writes himself into the series and states there that the concepts terrified him and that was why he put it in the back corner of his home under a bunch of other stuff. That a 17 year old could have such concepts as this to me wow, just blows me away. Ive read the series about 4 times now and am re-reading it now again. Every time, I see/understand some of he concepts better. Some of the later books have a bit of gore to them, but that is easily passed over. GREAT READING
An Intriguing Start So this was an odd book for me. It was a weird book in that even at the end I wasn't entirely sure what was going on. I have my theories, but that's all they are at this point. The world and the mythology, what readers learn of it by the end of the book (which isn't a lot), is revealed slowly, like peeling the layers of an onion. An intriguing, maddening, what-the-hell-is-it-REALLY onion. I feel a little like the gunslinger at the end...compelled to move on to find answers to something I don't fully understand. Again and again it ends this way. There are quests and roads that lead ever onward, and all of them end in the same place - upon the killing ground. Do I know what that quote means? Not necessarily but it sounds cool, right? *grin* I don't think this is an example of King's best work. He was young when he first wrote it and admits as much. He even went back in many years later to make revisions so that it flows better with the books that follow. But even with the obvious flaws, the book presented an interesting world, an enigmatic protagonist, and raised questions that definitely motivate me to read more so that I can get some answers to them.
Jump on at the beginning, but the best is yet to come. I want to say this carefully, because, in the end, "The Gunslinger" is a good book. It's mysterious, moody, and full of memorable imagery. You'll most likely be very glad you read it (especially in this new revised edition, which, interestingly, is tighter and yet breathes more at the same time). But you should be aware that this first volume in Mr. King's epic (and soon to be completed!) dark fantasy series does not quite reach the "must-read" status easily achieved by subsequent volumes in the "Dark Tower" epic. I'm betting, in fact, that many of you out there who read this book will say something positive but ultimately lukewarm at its close, something like this: "Good book, I'll have to pick up the next one one of these days." And that would be a mistake, because you should pick up volume 2 ("The Drawing of the Three") immediately, not "soon" or "someday". The second volume is THAT good, showcasing King's imagination firing on all cylinders, with memorable, amazing scenes happening right out of the box. The plan may have been at least partially intentional... King may have said, "let's give the readers something more reserved and thoughtful at first, and then hit them hard in volume two by stirring in the really amazing and visceral stuff." Anyway, read "The Gunslinger". It's great (I actually give it about three-and-a-half stars). But do yourself a favor and stay on the ride and keep reading the other books, when things really take off. Trust me, you'll be glad you did.
True Imagination It's quite a big deal when one of the most renowned authors of our time is influenced by the greatest artisan of fantasy writing. Stephen King was enamored by Tolkien's Lord of the Rings series of books and thus they became the inspiration that motivated him into creating what he considers his magnum opus: The Dark Tower series. King wanted to write a fantasy journey that he felt was just as epic and large in scope as the Fellowship's quest to destroy the Ring of Power atop Mount Doom. Though at the same time he wanted his tale to reflect his own personal style of writing and identity. With this in mind, King chose to forgo the traditional genre conventions of elves and dwarves in the favor of guns and cowboys while wrapping it up in his unique flair of mysticism. The result is a look and feel that retains King's knack for the unexplainable but still maintains a distinction from his other literary works of horror. It's unlike anything King has written before and frankly, it's unlike anything I've ever seen. The plot is very minimalistic, but I feel that was by design. Roland the Gunslinger is on a mission to defeat The Man in Black, an adversary he's been hunting for years. Though ultimately, The Man in Black is the stepping stone in his mission to find the Dark Tower. The central nexus point of time which has supposedly disrupted its natural flow resulting in the abnormalities seen in the book. While this is minimal when compared to other novels, the core of The Gunslinger is about Roland's journey and the people and places he sees along the way, making it more about the quest itself rather than the destination. Reading this book felt like being set adrift on a boat in the middle of the ocean. You have no bearings or sense of destination; you can only go where the wind takes you, wherever that may be. I liked the sense of freedom this gave the narrative, but if you're looking for a deep plot than you'll be disappointed. This is a book that's meant to let your mind and imagination wonder, not ponder. But what really sets The Gunslinger and the rest of the Dark Tower series apart is that it's an amalgamation of various different genres. By the book's cover it has obvious roots in the western genre, with King even admitting to being heavily inspired by the classic spaghetti western `The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly.' But there's much more than that, such as strong elements of low fantasy with the more fantastical segments taking place in a world that is supposedly like our own, and even some science-fiction from the elements of time travel. There's also a strong sense of mystery that surrounds the book and its characters. Who were the Gunslingers? What's the Dark Tower? And who or what is The Man in Black? Like Roland himself, you just have to press on, and hopefully the answers will be waiting at the end. This union of vastly different genres would have normally made for an incoherent novel that's trying to accomplish more than it can handle, yet King manages to keep it from falling apart in a believable fashion. Reflecting the arcane aspects of the world and his mission, Roland the Gunslinger is a man of mystery. He's the quintessential western folk hero, an enigmatic figure on a righteous path for justice. But as the story progresses and more insight into his past is revealed, the reader slowly begins to unravel more of the mysterious wanderer. Though while he's an excellent lead, he's hardly a character you can form an emotional attachment to. Whereas the young boy from the future, Jake, felt like the heart of the book for me. The companionship between Roland and the boy really brought a smile to my face and the perilous journey to find The Man in Black and the Dark Tower all the more daunting. The villain, The Man in Black, felt more like an entity rather than an actual character in the story. He's given very minimal attention and exposition, but his dark presence is always felt. Longtime King fans will recognize him as Randall Flagg, a character that King has included in many of his different works. Special attention must also be given to Stephen King's incredible prose that he uses to illustrate the book's mystifying flair of wonder. However, for me this came off as a rather double-edged sword. When The Gunslinger is at its best, King is able to transport the reader into a semi dream-like trance, further immersing them into the incredible world King has crafted and suspending their disbelief on the unexplainable events that transpire. The potential downside for me at least, is that some passages felt more like a disorganized mess of thoughts rather than a coherent narrative. Moments like these were frustrating and really pulled me out of the story. In the end, The Gunslinger was a bit of a mixed bag for me. I liked the sense of adventure and mystery King instilled with his unique style and the mashing of several classic genres into something that King can call his own. And while I don't usually prefer shallow plots, I am willing to make an exception with the direction King was taking the book. Yet I felt the narrative sometimes fell flat, and the ending was very unsatisfying. The Gunslinger is definitely worth checking out for its peculiarities, even if I don't absolutely love it, but I certainly do like it enough to see where this journey ends.
Get through it. You'll be happy you did. This is the first in a wonderous series about Roland the Gunslinger. Roland hails from Gilead, an ancient or possibly future civilization where the blood-line of King Arthur Eld is highly regarded as protectors of the world. Unfortunately, by the time we meet up with Roland, the world has moved on. Roland is following the man in black. We don't know who this mysterious figure is until the end of the book, but we do know that he holds the first clues for Roland on the quest for the Dark Tower. What is the Dark Tower? Amazingly enough, a lot of it is explained in this book, though it's hard to grasp the concept until one has read further into the series. The series opens us up to the concept of multiple worlds in multiple universes, all held together with beams, which are breaking and thus, the Tower is being destroyed. The Dark Tower series is also held together by beams. These beams are other King works. Any King fan should read this series because it opens up so many treats for the "constant reader." There are tie-ins everywhere. The Gunslinger is linked to the rest of the books in the series, which are linked to other King books such as Salem's Lot, The Stand, Insomnia, From a Buick 8, and Rose Madder (which is linked to Desperation and Regulators). Wow! All this depth and a great story to boot! As we follow Roland, his quest becomes our quest. Every journey starts with one step. The first step is "The Gunslinger."
Awesome start to what will assuredly be a fantastic series! I would say I've become a pretty big Stephen King fan, and I figured it wouldn't be official until I started the Dark Tower series. So far I've read this and The Drawing of the Three (the second book in the series). I have loved both and look forward to continuing the story. I think this first book was an amazing introduction to the Gunslinger's character, and the world he came from. I'd recommend this story to anyone who is a fan of King, or interested in getting started on a long multi-part journey. It's a LOT of fun. And the story really starts picking up in the second book.
First book best I'm on book three but the first book - Gunslinger - is by far my favorite so far. I did not enjoy the Drawing of 3 at all. Too much real world descriptions. The drug addict was friggin boring. Book 3 The Wastelands is very good so far.
Childe Richard...err....Roland... to the Dark Tower Came I saw a display for The Gunslinger and the other recently re-released Dark Tower novels in a bookstore recently, and decided to buy the first volume. I guess I'm a sucker for advertising, but I judged a book by its cover and thought it looked cool, and I had nothing else to read. I expected at least an adventure story, with plenty of six-shooter action that would keep my mind occupied for a while. I got that and a lot more out of The Gunslinger. I quickly saw that Stephen King was creating around me an entirely new world with a culture and mythology of the kind that I'm used to seeing in Tolkien and Herbert. King even draws some of his inspiration from a Robert Browning poem, "Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came", which I thought was pretty cool. I found The Gunslinger to be a fun, yet deep, read, and flew right through it. If you're even remotely curious about what The Gunslinger is, you should definitely check it out. If you normally don't read Stephen King novels for some reason, rest assured--this is pretty much unlike any other story of his I've seen. Any fans of fantasy should check this out too, although if you're not into fantasy (like me) you won't find any unicorns or leprechauns to laugh at, so don't be afraid. This is a book for anyone--go ahead and buy it, or just borrow it from a friend. You'll thank him.
The beginning of an interesting adventure. This books begins the adventure of the hero named Roland who seeks the Dark Tower. It is a good set up for the rest of the books in this series. On to book two so see what further adventures lie ahead for Roland as he continues his quest!
Soul searching alternate fantasy The plot is compelling and original. This is not your standard Stephen King book, because it straddle the fantasy genre with an original flair. At moments, it is quasi-psychedelic, and one cannot but wonder if there are some real life experiences embedded in the narrative. I have started to read this book out of curiosity, I'm now nearing the end of the second book, and so far I think I will go on. If you like the fantast theme interlaced with relics of our standard technlogy, you will appreciate it. But be also prepared to delve in the rambling minds of characters that we would normally consider borderline in our culture.
Thankee, Sai! The entire Dark Tower series of books are my favorite Stephen King works. I've read them all (several times, I might add) and can not put them down. When I first read The Gunslinger, I was so impressed with the difference of this story from all other King books I have read. I only recently read The Stand and I see that this has some similarities but it was a new style to me at the time. These books are not the typical Stephen King horror stories that so many people expect. This, along with all of the others in the series, deals with the epic tale of Roland, the last of the gunslingers. Roland lives in a world where time has moved on and is on a journey to the Dark Tower in order to attempt to stop the end of time. Each book takes you a little farther on his journey and opens Roland's character to you even more. This epic tale is a wonderful read and should be included in everyone's library. I have tried to get my friends who are not King fans to read these but have been unsuccessful. They all expect some gory tale (I love those too) and sadly will not give the books a try. As for me, I want to thank you, Mr. King for taking me to another world and introducing me to Roland and company. I have never found any other books that I feel so drawn to.
A little boring. I like King A little boring. I like King,and this is supposed to the revised start of his magnum opus. Based on a 19th century poem. The poem is cryptic and bleak, and so is this volume. I don't have much interest in reading thenext12 or 14 books.
Review- The Gunslinger This book is a great read. I have never read any of the series before picking this one up. After reading The Gunslinger, I went and got the entire Dark Tower series and wound up loving them all. This book is a great introduction to the series, it starts with Roland chasing after a mysterious man in black. As he travels through towns, across barren deserts and through bleak caves he encounters demons, goblins, and religious fanatics each section leaving you begging for more and more. The real kicker in this book comes at the end, just when you think it will end a certain way, your mind gets screwed with and you have to read the next novel to find out what happens. The ending to this book is great! The book is a combination of fantasy, sci fi, horror and western generes and masterfully blends them all into one brilliantly constructed, bleak, horrific version of our own world. This book is filled with emotion, action, violence and is a fast paced thriller that will inspire you to finish the entire series ASAP. Definately pick this book up, you will love it and you will read through it in a minute! Not only is this book great, but ever book in the Dark Tower Series is brilliantly written and does not let your attention stray for a second. Buy It!!
An entrance to an epic The Gunslinger is a very important book, it is the entrance to the grand epic of a long classic-to-be. In terms of writing style, the flow of the story, etc, Gunslinger is quite inconsistent with its sequels. Partly because they are several stories published in various magazines, partly because they were written before Mr. King was a more veteran author (that doesn't mean the stories are bad, they are just 'different' in style from the rest). To me, the rest of the volumes (i.e. from the Drawing of Three onwards) are much better in terms of creativity, imagination, surprise, intense moment, etc.... which makes this volume one a little bit like a prelude. However, one cannot simply miss this entry, or without reading it before reading other volumes. First, it gives some important events and history of Roland, the Gunslinger. Also as a 'constant reader' of Mr. King, you can compare his writing skills and styles during these years. Finally, as Mr. King himself ambitiously says he wants to write a longest epic story in American history. Whether it can be as popular as Lord of the Ring, we need time to prove it. But definitely, he is successful in producing an interesting and absorbing story, and obviously the longest one in our history.
Mine's greatest work I have always liked Stephen King's novels, though not all of them. Occasionally by subject one doesn't appeal to me but most are great and many become favorites. The Dark Tower series is one enormous book in multiple volumes. It took him a long time to finish and went some surprising directions. This is the best he's ever done, that simple. Buy them all, you won't want to put this down.
Great as Always! I love Stephen King, always have. This series was recommended by a friend back in the early 2000's and I am very happy to be getting into it now. The plot is great (as usual with Mr. King). I recommend this for all avid King readers!!!!! (Who have probably already read it.) :)
The man in black fled across the desert, and you should follow. As a fellow author, I can certainly appreciate the history behind the Gunslinger, a manuscript that sat in a box in Mr. King's garage for many years before he decided to pick it up, re-write it, and continue the story of Roland, the last gunslinger. I first found this book as a teenager who, although not a Stephen King fan, was desperate for epic storytelling and there were already three books in the series. (Little did I know that I would be waiting over a decade for the series to be concluded.) Having read quite a bit more of Mr. King's works over the years, I can say that the writing style is very reflective of his earlier horror entries, but the epic-western-fantasy is a fair departure from the the genres in which Mr. King normally worked. The Gunslinger works nicely in that way whether you like King, or like epic storytelling, you will probably enjoy the book. The Gunslinger is quite a bit shorter than the other entries in the Dark Tower series and serves as a good introduction. The only negative thing to say about this book is that it's not as good as its successors- The Drawing of the Three or the Wastelands.
Just Not My Thing I consider myself a pretty loyal Stephen King horror book fan. I ate up everything he put out in the early part of his career, except for this series. Something about the premise kept me away. But after hearing everyone rave about it, I had to at least give it a try. Epic doesn't even begin to describe this story. Everything about this book screams that King is trying to create a masterpiece that rivals other fantasy epics like The Lord of the Rings. King uses a lot of metaphors (sometimes way too many), a lot of philosophical discussion about the universe, time, space, and our position within all of it, and a lot of dreamy (and unimaginable) imagery. All of this is to paint a picture of another world/dimension/universe where time has been altered and things have gone wrong. The only person who wants to do something to fix it is the protagonist, Roland, aka the Gunslinger, who has been trained to kill and is armed with his special guns. The story opens with Roland in the middle of his journey to fix all that is wrong in the universe, or perhaps its just to avenge all that has been done, we're never sure. What we do know is that he's chasing after The Man in Black, who has played some significant part in why things are so messed up in his world. Roland wants to kill The Man in Black (with his guns, of course!), but before he does, he wants The Man to give him information about The Tower. What is the Tower? Well, according to The Man in Black, The Tower has something to do with the universe, time, and a higher power. I didn't quite get what it was all about, and I don't think Roland or the reader is supposed to either, not until the very end of this saga (and several books later). It's an interesting premise, the problem is, I don't quite understand or believe it enough to invest any more time in it. Unlike King's previous efforts, I never immersed myself completely in the story to the point where I forgot I was reading a novel. You can feel King's ambition and desire to create an epic, unworldly story that somehow delivers a statement about the universe we live in. It's not quite pretentious, but almost. There were parts of the story that really grabbed me. King is a master at tapping into basic human fear and shaking you up, but unfortunately in this novel, the scares run few and far between. Also, Roland's character development was too slow to keep me interested. I never really "got" him or his struggle and as a result, I don't care if he finds The Tower, because I don't really care about him and The Tower sounds too abstract and unbelievable anyway. So sadly, this is where my journey with Roland ends.
Bored At least, having only managed about 60% of this book I don't have to read the rest of the (6?) of the series. Just read 11.22.63 by Mr King and it was FANTASTIC! This however ...bleh ... Don't get it....sorry. Maybe it's me?
Starting over at the beginning. Read in hard back years ago and when the final novel in the series was published I wanted to start over at the beginning and read the whole story again from beginning to end without a 20+ year gap between books.Really enjoyed finally being able to read this way. Highly recommend fans doing the same as this is Stephen King at his finest.
The beginning - kind of hard to grade... "The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed." Well, what can we actually guess about this kind of strange beginning?! Neither do we know who is the gunslinger, nor who's the man in black. And what's the gunslinger's point to follow the man in black?!?! If ones goes on, one will learn at least that a Tower is the reason for the weird chase through the world apart from ours here. The gunslinger was once sent out to reach the tower and so to save his world from dying out. For this task nothing can stop him, and he doesn't care about anyone or anything if he can just reach the tower... I think one can see this part of the serie as an interlude to the GREATEST book series I ever came to read, maybe even the world's greatest generally, we'll see. Well, I refused one star because for some people I know it became so hard to follow the story that they gave up reading at about the halfth of the book, and I can kind of understand their feelings because on some points the story's really kind of weird and hard to follow, BUT DON'T STOP; JUST CONTINUE WITH THE NEXT PART!!!!!
Reflections... After the World Has Moved On... As any Constant Reader of the King Experience knows, it takes some time and inner searching to glean what the man is saying. Some novels are pure pulp; some are psycholgical explorations; others, pure science fiction. In the Dark Tower series, I have felt an attempt at alienation - non specific, that is to say not aimed at any type of reader or fan(atic)- but something to say to those who believe in Vampires or sentient rabid dogs, spaceships buried beneath the soil of Maine, Insane trucks, laundry machines or malevolent lawnmowers - those who would judge the work THE GUNSLINGER simply because of the first few pages. "I don't want to read a horror Zane Grey novel! " they shout. I don't either, and I didnt. What I read was a book full of the joy and terror of a man exploring a new type of storytelling. A beginning to inflame the thirst of New and old Constant Readers. Magnificent imagery, convoluted turns of reality. Just enough to cling to the promise of the next installment of The Dark Tower. Excellent work. Superior continuity... unbearable "waiting for the next thing".
This is the first book in a great series. The dark tower is a long and ... This is the first book in a great series. The dark tower is a long and dark tale about the last gunfighter is a post-apocalyptic. This book follows Roland through the desert as he chases his adversary. Roland experiences pain, love, starvation, fear, death, and loneliness in this short book. I highly recommend this book for anyone who is into the dark themed books, the Dark Tower series is as dark as it gets.
I don't see the hype Maybe I lack patience. The story unraveled too slow, coupled with a monosyllabic slow drawl dialogue that gave me a headache. There's little that makes you root for the gunslinger. I read the Wiki notes on the first four books, and it sounds so bizarre I think I'm glad I put it down 35% of the way through.
Fine Entry into Roland's World(s) I'm a huge fan of Stephen King, and have re-visited his novels quite often. With that said, I'm not a huge fan of his "Dark Tower" series. I think there are shining moments in the series, and I really liked the premise. I think Roland is a fascinating character, but he gets saddled with some of King's worst character creations, and put into almost absurd situations which relegate him to an almost secondary character in his own epic? I will say that off all of King's works, I've revisited this series more often than any single novel he's written, and there are a couple reasons for that. First, I was an early reader of this series, reading "The Gunslinger" when "The Drawing of the Three" was first published, and then re-reading each novel in the series as new novels were released. Overall I would guess that I've read this first novel about 7-8 times, both the original printing and the revised edition. Second, and more important where this review is concerned, I love this first novel, and rank it as one of my favorite King novels. As the novel opens we meet Roland, the last Gunslinger, as he chases The Man in Black across the desert. Roland is on a quest to find the "Dark Tower" and believe The Man in Black is his key to finding the Tower. As Roland is making his way across the desert plains, we learn of his visit to the small, dying town of Tull, and the people he met there and the ultimate fate of that town. Roland also meets a young boy named Jake that he believes The Man in Black set in his path deliberately as a trap. Jake has no clue how he came to Roland's world, and we learn that he came from modern day New York City. Roland tells Jake about his history and his world, we learn why he is chasing the Man in Black and about his quest for the Tower. "The Gunslinger" is a quick intro in the The Dark Tower saga, but it sets the stage for a much bigger story (as we'll learn with the several novels that follow), "The Gunslinger" isn't really a complete story, and if you do pick up this novel, be prepared to start on the long journey to the Dark Tower with Roland and company, as you'll want to hear more of the story and see where it goes.
Great Read The Gunslinger book, the first of The Dark Tower books, is an amazing read. The book is very different from the horror classics that Stephen King is known for. If you are wanting a capturing page-turner, you should begin The Dark Tower series. The Gunslinger is among the best of the series.
A fantastic start to an incredible series Though partially inspired by Robert Browning's poem, "Childe Roland"--, and the fact that the story has been alive for 20+yrs in the author's mind is a testament of the power that the story held over the author. There has always been a feeling that "The Gunslinger," at under 300 pages, is just right to introduce us to the world of The Dark Tower and Roland as the last Gunslinger. He is a likeable, realistic character who shares a wide range of feelings and reflections that will make you wonder if you should love and hate him. The Gunslinger is an easy to read and just hints at the history, tragedies and issues of Roland's life. His search through the barren wasteland in search of the elusive Man in Black shows through flashbacks a small inkling of the real complexity of the series to come. The incredible realism of the characters in this strange world is fascinating. The book is a true joy for all fans of magic, horror, quest and westerns. Roland appears to be a complex mix of individuals including man in Clint Eastwood's "Man With No Name" type westerns. It's difficult to find a fantasy that can really make you sit back and think. This series has great characters, a fairly fast paced story, one of the most original worlds since Tolkien and of course is beautifully put together by Stephen King. He creates a universe, that slowly but surely was connected to most of his other books. It is amazing how all the bits and pieces of the other books fit into the Dark Tower series and you think `Yeah that's how it should fit together.' This whole series of books rank among my favourites and now that they are on my Kindle I have reread them again for about the 10th time. I'm sure if you read the 1st book The Gunslinger you will be hooked... whether you are a Stephen King fan or not.
The books leading up to the last book were very good but the last book was anti-climatic starting reading this in 1987. It took King over 30 years to complete the series. The books leading up to the last book were very good but the last book was anti-climatic. He got pissed off because his readers were wondering when in the hell he was going to finish the series so he wrote a scathing response to the readers as in go f yourselves. What an arrogant a hole.
Great book from a great author Stephen King is an amazing writer that never lets a book get boring. His structure is incredible and his characters are fascinating. This book is not different. The end was not quite what I was expecting, but it certainly made me want to read the rest of the series.
A little abstract I've heard so many glowing recommendations of this series that I finally had to read it myself. Mostly I'm vaguely disappointed. It was harsh, bizarre, and abstract. It failed to capture my imagination or thrill me. I'm glad I'm done with it.
Excellent introduction into a different world The Gunslinger: The Dark Tower, Book 1 is an excellent book that plunges the reader into a whole new world. The novel tells the story of Roland of Gilead, the last gunslinger, who is chasing after the mysterious man in black. In his search, Roland comes upon several great characters that help him in his search. The book is confusing at times, leaving many questions unanswered that will be dealt with in the later novel of the series. Even with these questions, it is still a great read leaving the reader wanting more and more to find the answers to these questions. One of the best parts of the story was the conversation between Roland and the man in black as they discuss the origins of man. This is a great story full of excellent characters and beautiful settings that won't allow you to put the book down. For a fantastic introduction to the series, check out The Gunslinger: The Dark Tower, Book 1.
What an incredible beginning! "The Gunslinger" is a very nice suprise compared to the beginning's of a great many series out there, though this Revised edition is not what was originally published back in 1982. It follows the story of Roland Deschain, a gunslinger and knight-errant, and his pursuit of Walter O' Dim (The Man In Black), who is supposed to to guide Roland to the object of his quest, the Dark Tower of existance. Quit stylized and nicely languaged, a large part of The Gunslinger is told in a series of flashbacks of his early years growing up in Gilead, as Roland moves across the desert and later under the mountains with a boy from 1970's New York named Jake. If you want a well paced, intriguing, and cool new series to pick up, The Gunslinger is the way to go for anyone starting on The Dark Tower series. NOTE: The Gunslinger's ending is very very well done!
Well-written, seductive intro to the series This is the first installment of THE DARK TOWER series, begun when King was a student, and finished 12 years later. Until recently, I hadn't realized King was a fantasy author, in addition to his other accomplishments. I was a kid who grew up reading THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA and THE LORD OF THE RINGS, and spending hours searching attics & basements for a gateway to another world. So I decided I might like The Dark Tower. After reading customer reviews, and A Dark Tower Primer, A List By Elena, I expected this book to be inaccessible. I thought it would take time and background reading for me to get into it, and that perhaps I never would. Nothing could be further from the truth. I was hooked before I had finished reading the first page. Why? The first 16 pages describe a lone figure crossing an absolutely barren landscape in pursuit of another lone figure. What made those 16 pages so compelling? Mostly, it's the descriptions. King describes the desert so you can see it, hear it, even smell it. As the narrative continues and the lone figure begins to interact with other characters, a vivid individual is revealed - so gradually, so slowly - behind the archetypal "gunslinger". I didn't find the book as puzzling as I expected from the customer reviews. It seemed clear to me it was taking place in some sort of post-apocalyptic future which exists in a parallel universe or dimension to our own. It's not true that it answers none of its own questions, it just doesn't answer all of them, as befits the first chapter of a series. My only criticism is that the prose falters at a few points. Surprisingly, not in the part of the book written when King was very young (the beginning) but later, when he was already an experienced published author. I'm only referring to a few phrases where my absorption in the book was broken by a thought such as "eew, why did he choose those words?" The only example I can find or think of is a phrase such as "the boy threw up his hands" (he did? How had he managed to swallow his own hands?) I only mention it because normally this never happens when I am reading a King novel. In this book, there are long scenes in which nothing very much happens, or only dialogue and description, punctuated by 2 scenes of extreme violence. Usually people who like "action" and people who like dialogue and description can never agree on a book. Usually people who like reading violent scenes don't like long descriptive passages, and people who do like them can't bear reading about violence. But this is not your usual book. If you like fantasy, or if you like King but have never read his fantasy work, definitely check it out. Dark Tower fans need no recommendation, of course. If you like descriptive narrative prose, you probably look down on King, but overcome your prejudice long enough to take a look at this book.
A Genre Surprise A twisting turning plot that held my interest. I really wanted to know what was to happen next. This is the first book of Stephen King's Dark Tower series and I read it with relish. I had not known that King had written in this genre. My wife's book club had it for a read for one of their meetings. She recommend it to me and I was surprise that King had written and that it was so good (for me).
Epic begining So for years I have heard about this series and wondered if it was really as good as everyone has said. After a brief pause from reading, I finally got the reading bug again and decided I had to give it a try. At first I started reading this knowing full well it was all lead in and it might be slow, but in one sitting I had already finished 100 pages. Still I was unsure if I liked it but as days went by I found that I couldn't stop thinking about this book. I had to know what was going to happen next and I had so many questions that it drew me in every time I picked it up. Stephen King did such a great job with this first book, that even though it is setting the stage for what is yet to come, and it posses more questions than it answers. I was so entertained with each new section that I can't wait to get the second to continue with Roland on his quest for the Dark Tower.
A Whole New World I love when Stephen King delves into fantasy more than horror and The Gunslinger is a great example of that. Obviously, there are elements of horror but my favorite part of this story is the way King creates a new world that I wanted to dwell in for years despite the things that lurk around every corner.
Roland is the Coolest Gun in Everwhere This revised version of the Gunslinger makes for easier reading. I really flew threw this one enjoying every obstacle along the way. Roland is definitely a Clint Eastwood type. I wouldn't want to be his road buddy though and if you read this book you'll find out why. The Crimson King spans his power out everywher, and Roland is on a quest to stop it.The Dark Tower is where he can make everything right again. Time is unbalanced and just plain weird. Roland doesn't have all the answers but he will find out. The Man in Black is another quest for Roland. Roland is willing to give everything up to seek the Man in Black; he is willing to give even more up to get to the Dark Tower. Read this series it is worth devoting your life to. Besides Stephen King is finished with the series. Let Roland and his ka-tet take you beyond your own world.
The End of the Beginning The Dark Tower isn't a typical Steven King read. It's more The Stand-esque in that it isn't much of a horror book. It incorporates minimal horror elements (I'm sure King couldn't help it), but plays out like an adventure or even a fantasy novel. It's an enticing read that makes you hunger for more of what King has to offer with the series. Unlike a lot of King's other works, this one isn't really dense and somewhat hard to put down once you start reading. The opening of the book is slow, but it really picks up around the middle of the first part. Also, the illustrations are very aesthetically pleasing. My only complaints with this book are the afforementioned slow opening and the somewhat overuse of foreshadowing. But other than those 2 flaws, the book is a solid read and makes you want to read the other 6 books.
Sometimes slow, always weird and worth it. Great story, I was sold on the series after finishing Book 1. Sometimes it was slow going and sometimes it got really weird but the world was so rich and the characters so well crafted. This is one of my favorite series.
King's greatest work As with most King novels you don't want the book to end. The Gunslinger series especially keeps you engrossed through all seven books. Part sci-fi, part odyssey, part spaghetti western makes this series King's best work! I read all 7 books over the course of one summer!!
Short and Sweet An all-around excellent book. A tad off the beaten track, even compared to the rest of this great series, partially due to the time gap between books 1 and 2. The writing style is intriguing, however, and the plot moves along at a brisk clip. You'll finish this book in no time and be ravenous for book 2, which I believe is the best of the series. The book is well described as a cross between Lord of the Rings and an old Clint Eastwood western. It makes quite an interesting blend: a world with both magic and guns in it, something that's relatively rare in a fantasy world. Definetly a must read for either King fans or fantasy fans. Honestly I had never read one of King's books before this, but this one certainly hit the mark. Highly recommended.
The first step... the man in black fled across the desert and the gunslinger followed... I first read this when I was 12. I have read the entire series annually ever since. By far the best thing that King has ever written. This is the first volume in a sprawling saga that pulls the reader in with the very first sentence and doesn't let go. If you only read one book by Stephen King make it this one.
Pick it up, you won't regret it! I am not someone that reads Stephen King books. Other than reading The Green Mile when I was much younger, I have actually actively steered clear of them. Then I started dating this guy that swore by how amazing the Dark Tower series was. I had never heard of it, and just shrugged off his recommendation. But, for my birthday, he ended up giving me The Gunslinger, and then proceeded to pester me to read it. I am SO glad he pestered me!! There were moments that I was thinking, "What the heck is going on?!?", but in a really great way! I just finished book 5 of the Series (Wolves of the Calla), and my mind is truly blown. This is such an amazing twist of genres, you can't even really explain it. It is some combination of western, sci-fi, fantasy, and who knows what else. All these are genres that I don't actively seek out to read. But, it magically works in this series. And The Gunslinger is where it all begins. Do yourself a favor and pick this one up! My only complaint (and this is not against THIS book), is that you cannot find all 7 books from the same publisher/printing. Your first 4 books will look one way - and I do recommend the non-mass market paperwork version of this revised edition. It has a great size and feel for a book of this length, plus the added pictures. Then, the last 3 of the series will look a different way; and they don't have the same size or feel of the first 4. Not a huge deal, but something to be aware of when you're purchasing the physical books instead of the Kindle edition.
"The Gunslinger" Review by Robbie Messer "The Gunslinger" is different from Stephen King. Pretty much the entire "Dark Tower" series is. This first volume in the 8 book series, if that is, you include "The Wind Through The Keyhole" is argued as the worst in the series, because it's a slow start to King's "magnum opus" and that it is hard to get through. I, being prepared for it (and also for the Dark Tower), got ready. The main plot of "The Gunslinger" is Roland Deschain, the last gunslinger, chasing the man in black across a different world which was originally like our Earth, except for some differences. Now, it's like a post-apocalyptic world, deserted. The first line of the story ("The man in black fled across the desert and the gunslinger followed.") pulls you into the story immediately. There is something about it that line that is so intriguing. Okay. After the first section of the first chapter is a flashback. Basically, the whole story is a flashback; so I highly recommend reading it slow to understand what's going on or else you will be confused. Roland is not a good man, in this case. He is vicious, cruel, and doesn't care about anyone but himself. That may be why some readers were put down. Throughout the story, you will read how he became the gunslinger that he is, and I won't spoil it. There is a young boy named Jake Chambers, who Roland runs into along the way. While there isn't much character development in "The Gunslinger", it didn't really bother me. I was too anxious to find out what's next. There are cons. First off, some of the text were unnecessary, complicated, and kinda put me off. It felt forced (it took 12 years for King to write this, and you could tell by the writing sometimes), and could have been reduced. King uses hard words a little too much. The High Speech is fine, but the words in the detail stopped me occasionally. Sometimes, the flashbacks when Roland was younger came up more often than they should though they were interesting to read. I liked "The Gunslinger" but because of the problems, I gave it four stars. I understood what was going on most of the time. The setting is awesome, and the characters were good enough. I can't wait to continue Roland's journey in "The Drawing of the Three" and hopefully more! RATING: 80/100
Stellar! I seldom give 5 star reviews, but this is my 6th time reading this series. I think this is without doubt his best work; in this series King's use of language, description and, above all his intensely flawed, intensely human characters are at their finest!
Great Start to the Dark Tower series Displaying elements of modern culture intermingled with a story which is part Fantasy, part Science Fiction, part Horror, and overall Western is a weird feat only achievable by Stephen King. He manages to put together the most unlikely of stories with a good mix of horror, humor, action, and a high gross-out factor in parts. This is the story of Roland, the last of the gunslingers as he pursues the mysterious Man in Black across the desert and over the mountains, striving to reach his ultimate goal, the Dark Tower. Why? I have no idea. What he plans to do with at tower when he arrives is a topic to be discussed in future volumes. In the meantime, enjoy the action as Roland encounters a talking bird, drops acid, is designated the Antichrist, discloses the secrets of his past, and encounters a succubus (but not necessarily in that order). This unabridged audio version was read by the author. I had previously mentioned that Stephen King is a better writer than reader in my review of "Blood and Smoke", but my opinion of him moved up a notch here. His reading here was still not the best I've heard (Frank Muller is a master here), but better than some professional readers. This story ends on an open note which piqued my interest in following Roland to the second in the Dark Tower series, "The Drawing of the Three".
The World has moved on As long as this series is(8 books), it is definitely worth the time. This was the shortest of them and one of the best. King makes you want to read all of these as quickly as possible. When I read this the first time I had to wait for the next book to come out, now as I start again I can binge read until I'm done.
Good book! I've been thinking about reading this book for years. After 3 different false starts I finally finished it and am glad I did. It feels very different from other King novels but it is well written and engaging. The world of the story is intriguing and I am excited to begin book 2.
Not much here. It's not Kings best, very different from any of his books I've ever read. Has a few good moments in it, but prepare to be a little discombobulated at times . I'm trying this series more out of curiosity than want. In his foreword King mentioned the series starts slow, I realize he was still early in his career when he wrote this, so I hope the next book has a little more early 90's King flair to the writing.
Just as good if not better the 2nd time around The first time I started this series was almost 30 years ago. I loved everything Stephen King wrote and still do. I was 16 the first time I held the first Dark Tower book in my hand and devoured it in less than a week. It was several years before the Drawing of The Three was released. I remember how hard it was to wait in agony to find out where Roland's quest would lead him next! I love this series because it is so different from Sai King's usual story, and because he writes so well that you can watch everything unfold like a movie in your mind. I love finding references to other characters from different books interwoven in each other. I definitely recommend this series to anyone who enjoys fantasy with a bit of darkness woven in for good measure. Long days and pleasant nights to ya!
up front it's making reading this book a chore instead of a delight. This story does not flow well. The reader is presumed to understand things which have not been explained yet, or it was done on purpose to create a moment towards the end of this book or book series that will let a reader look back with understanding. But, up front it's making reading this book a chore instead of a delight.
Really bad I bought this book because I had seen so many reviews that said if you just power through this one, the second is much better. I was looking for a new series to get into so I decided why not. I generally like Stephen King, and I'm a huge fan of fantasy books. Unfortunately, "power through" is an understatement for what it takes to get through this book. Honestly, even Mr. King himself writes that this book is tough to get through. Knowing that, this volume in the series should have been free. The story dumps you in on Roland, the gunslinger and from there seems to go every which way but straight. There are so many vague sections here that at times, I honestly felt like I was reading something written by someone deranged with a fever. Nothing makes sense and at times, that can become very frustrating with this book. I did manage to plow through this and then purchased the second book of the series. While better than the first, I seriously recommend you save your money. I finished the second book with no desire to continue the story. If you are determined to read the series, then have at it. Nothing I could say would change your mind but if you are on the fence, give this one a hard pass.
ABSOLUTELY THE BEST The greatest series ever. So intricate and well written, and not horror. Readers of all ages and beliefs can enjoy the Gunslinger and the other six books. And the one-liners and humor is hilarious. Stephen King in king in this series.
All The Enjoyment of a Snakebite Well, I girded my loins, bit the bullet and spent money I figured would be a waste on the first book of the Dark Tower. I am sure King is a good author (theoretically) but unfortunately this book did not display that. It was bad enough that I did something I have NEVER done before, I read spoilers for the final books ending just to see if maybe the series got any better. No spoilers, suffice it to say this the first and LAST Dark Tower book I shall subject myself to.
I am part way through the third book in the series and it is as wonderful as the first As with all Stephen King's work I found the theme and story line intriguing right from the very first page. The way he moves his characters from one time period to another without the reader noticing big gaps in the story, and the magical way he reviews the past with the present in terms of the story brings the brilliance of his skill to the fore. His characters are so real, the reader is never out of contact with the caste and is totally involved in all that they do and say. I am part way through the third book in the series and it is as wonderful as the first. The settings are well described and readable, the theme and character changes subtle and believable. His gift places him at the forefront of his craft.
An excellent beginning to one of the most unique fantasy/sci-fi/westerns of all time I don't feel as if any review I would write could do justice to the uniqueness of this novel or improve on any previous reviews by other Dark Tower fans. King's foreword in The Gunslinger really prepares the reader the best for what's in store. Inspired by The Lord of the Rings, Clint Eastwood and spaghetti westerns, and the poem: Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came, a master of horror wrote an epic, time-warped by refer and his wildest imaginings, that became The Dark Tower series. There is nothing quite like The Gunslinger. I have yet to recommend this book to anyone who regretted reading it.
Hoping.... it gets clearer. I have read reviews that say the second book and onward gets better and better and that is what I'm hoping for. This one has great promise and holds your interest, but a lot of it is cryptic and convoluted. I assume more of the background will be clarified and, if so, would certainly make for a more enjoyable read. I'm sticking with it and plan to read the entire series.
as it has been recommend to me for over a decade now Looking forward to the rest of the series, as it has been recommend to me for over a decade now. The first installment has its issues (as King himself says), but was enjoyable nonetheless. However, I am hoping for more in the following books. For, if they do keep pace with book one, I will probably bail.
Surreal amalgalm of familiar and unfamiliar This novel is intended to introduce readers to the world of Stephen King's Dark Tower series. It takes place in a 'world that's moved on' (e.g. it once had automobiles and other machines, but know resembles some bizarre amalgalm of the Wild West and a fantasy setting. The protagonist, Roland of Gilead, grew up in a place that reminded me more of something from King Arthur's court, what with the hieararchy and training of youth. The book centers on Roland of Gilead completing his lengthy journey to find the man in black, who has knowledge of Roland's fate and how Roland can get to the Dark Tower. There are several flashbacks to tell about Roland's childhood and his stay in a desert town. This book is a unique combination of fantasy and horror. It works to combine the familiar with the unfamiliar in a way that makes it seem almost surreal. In that sense, it at times feels like more of a fantasy than a fantasy story with dragons and dwarves. My personal favorite part of this novel is the man in black's monologue at the very end. I won't spoil anything, but I will say that the way he built up to speak of the most terrifying thing out there is really believable. It's pretty freaky. There aren't any allusions to other works by Stephen King in this book, as those come later on in the series.
One of my favorites This is one of my favorite books ever, it's a great Stephen king novel and the first of his eight book dark tower series. If you are considering reading this series do yourself a favor and do it immediately. You grow to love the characters throughout the series. This is the shortest of the series and serves as an introduction.
Middle Earth Meets Sergio Leone I don't know what took me so long to start this series. Perhaps in my mind I was thinking Western novel. Knowing very little about it I found it strange, hypnotic, similar, and yet nothing like any other Stephen King book. The novel introduces Roland, a gunslinger chasing the man in black, in a world like ours, but not our world. The book has a new introduction by King where he explains the origins of the novel as well as why he revised the book.For newcomers, it's the beginning of a planned seven book odyssey. Looking forward to reading book 2.
A few flaws and a weak part mar a fantastic book. While the first story in Stephen King's Dark Tower series wasn't his best work, it was a still a good book. Roland, the last and perhaps deadliest Gunslinger of any world, is in pursuit of the Man in Black. While in pursuit of the Man in Black, several traps are placed. There is an epic gunfight in a small town, a large desert to be crossed, mountains to be scaled, and mutants to be fought. Along the way, Roland meets Jake (who is a child from Earth). Jake acompanies Roland for most of the journey and plays a key role in the book. King's book is rich in plot and character developement, but there are slow parts and other times where you think he get's a tad bit over-descriptive. The Slow Mutants could have been much more involving and interesting, but really wasn't suspensful or interesting. Over all, this is a good book that I would suggest to fans of his work and people interested in mythical adventures, but horror and terror fans should look elsewhere.
Amazing... ...is really the only word to describe the first book in the Dark tower series. we are introduced to our protagonist Roland, of the moved-on Gilead, and while he is one of the most unlikeable people, love him just the same. This story may be one of King's shortest(231, in the expanded edition), but it is easily one of his best(possibly for that reason). We travel with Roland through the desert after the man in black. we first meet John "Jake" Chambers in this book. Its is just an extremely well-written, fast-paced western novel with some horror thrown in to keep it more "King-like". If you like King at all you should have read this years ago, if not pick it up now. for those of you, who never have, this is definately a good one to start with. If you don't like it(other than me then thinking your choice in authors is poor), it is short enough you will not feel ripped off, and it is a great stand-alone book. Otherwise continue onward to finish the journey to the Dark Tower, it is a bumpy, and amazing ride.
The beginning of the road The Gunslinger is the first book of seven in the Dark Tower series. It is the beginning of a long & windy road that takes Roland Deschain (the gunslinger) on a wild journey in search for the Dark Tower--a portal and center of many worlds. Stephen King's wild mind brings the reader through all of the emotions by making all the characters come to life; you feel as though you're with them. And of course, as Stephen King likes to do, there is a twisty ending to the entire series that leaves the reader in shock and disbelief. I highly recommend reading the whole Dark Tower series but be warned, after reading The Gunslinger, there are approximately 3600 pages to go but well worth the time!
Interesting World This first book in The Dark Tower series starts out at a slow pace, but as always Stephen King's descriptions quickly birth a new world in my mind. "The Gunslinger" also known as Roland is on a quest, the story begins with him chasing after "The Man in Black" also known as Walter o 'Dim. This first in a series leads you and gives you a dim idea of what is to come, but doesn't reveal to much...still it does make me want to read the next book, to find out what this world is about. It leaves me with questions such as What is this world? Is it another version of earth? Is it afterlife? All good questions that I look forward to finding answers to in the next few books. Overall I can't give it a five start simply because I found it slightly confusing, but still a great book.
An early masterpiece from the King.. "The Gunslinger" is hard to categorize. Quickly paced action scenes mingled with clearly realized visions of a bleak, post-apocalyptic world that may or may not be Earth are woven together into a finely detailed tapestry of a story, one that is surprisingly short from an author who is not known for his brevity. The prose stands out when compared to his later works as nearly hypnotic, a sweeping and epic dream that stands the test of time with ease. Highly recommended, even if you typically don't like horror.
Better the second time I read the Dark tower books several years ago upon the recommendation of a friend. I wasn't that much into Stephen King. I found this first book confusing but later on I got an inkling what the author was doing. This time I found the characters and settings have a mythical tone. I got that Gunslinger is like Ulysses, a hero who redeems his world.
I am still trying to decide. I love Stephen King books but I don't know if I really liked this one or if it was just OK. King is such a great writer that he keeps the reader busy. Maybe I just didn't care for the plot but then again maybe I did. I know there are several books in the series but right now I don't have the desire to read them - but not saying I won't. Indecision!
Unique and interesting, and I will check out book II of the series I didn't really know what to expect when I started reading "The Gunslinger: The Dark Tower I" by Stephen King. "The Stand" is still one of my favorite novels, and I recently enjoyed "Under The Dome." However, I didn't get into this novel as much as those two. It was creative, and King is a genius and master storyteller. But it just didn't click with me the way I anticipated it to when I began. I don't really read much horror, and that is why I've only read two of King's novels. And this book is not horror, but more of a fantasy quest story. The pacing of this tale was very different and that may be why I wasn't drawn in as fully as I thought I'd be when I started, as the other couple of King novels did suck me in and keep me captivated until the very end. On the other hand, there were parts of this story that held me spellbound, wanting to know what would come next. The odd assortment of characters, along with this quest to find the dark tower, does make me want to continue the books in this Dark Tower series to see where it takes the gunslinger and to find out what happens to him along the way. I enjoy his internal struggle, the good vs. evil element, and wondering just where things will go next. While I can't rave about this book as I do "The Stand," it is definitely a unique and interesting read, and one that makes me want to read the next in the series.

Rereading before the film And another re-read… This is my third time to read ‘The Gunslinger’ but the first time to read this newer edition. My responses over the course of the three reads have gone from: Hmm, to Meh, and then meh. It’s really just a small prologue more than anything. The Drawing of the Three gets into everything in much more detail, and is a better book, but a vastly more complicated one as well. From a simplicity standpoint, I actually think the Gunslinger is an effective way to create a new myth that wasn’t really sustained in Drawing. But with the movie coming out, the wife and I are going to attempt to get through the whole Dark Tower, so the journey begins again. The Gunslinger reads like a handful of entwined short stories more than a novel, and that lends it a sort of dream quest quality, which I quite liked. I’d like to see the later books return to this style. I also appreciate the merits of the ‘journey’ over the merits of the ‘goal’. The actual dark tower is very much just a McGuffin to give Roland , the gunslinger, a reason to go one a long quest through a crazy moved on world. The dark tower itself doesn’t really matter, it’s the tower at the end of everyone’s life… and from a fan’s standpoint (and a fan that hasn’t read past book three yet (SK loves parentheticals by the way)), I almost liked the idea of the DARK TOWER better when it was unfinished. We’ll see if he can pull it off. Mr. King tends to struggle with endings, and the larger the book, the bigger the struggle with said ending, in my opinion, so I’ll keep my hopes on the pragmatic side.
This book is just ok, but you have to read it. NOW! I had to make two attempts to read this book. The first time, I put it down about 50 pages in, bored. I decided it just wasn't for me. A decade later, after having so many people lambaste me for not having read this series, I tried again. I am so glad I did. This first book is just OK. It's a decent read. It isn't anywhere near King's best (and it shouldn't be, being so early in his career), but it is SO WORTH READING. This mediocre book starts you on one of the greatest literary journeys you will ever take. Get this book, power through it, and from there onward this entire series is 5-stars all the way!! Hile, Gunslinger!
What a great start to a great series Stphen King's The Dark Tower series are not really horror but fantasy. The world he sets the books in are more dream like, but they are parallel with the world that human beings are living in. I found The Gunslinger to be a very good start with the series. I read some reviews and most people said the book lacks of action. But how? The Gunslinger goes back and forth between Roland's past becoming a gunslinger to his search for the Man in Black (which is one of Stephen King's greatest enemies, Randal Flagg). Even though its a shorter book, I found this to be a page turner. It does have somewhat a H.P. Lovecraft feel to it, but that's only me. Nonetheless, The Gunslinger is by far one of my favorite Stephen King books, and it will lead on to one of the bst series in books. The Gunslinger is a five star rating in my eyes!
Stephen King is not one of my favourite authors. I consider much of his work derivative Stephen King is not one of my favourite authors. I consider much of his work derivative, drawing on the works of H.P. Lovecraft and Algernon Blackwood. So when a passing acquaintance suggested the Dark Tower series was different, I was hesitant. While waiting for Richard Kadrey's "Runaway God" to come out, I was looking for a book and decided to give Stephen King a second chance. I am glad I did. I thoroughly enjoyed "The Gunslinger", Roland is believable as the damaged hero, and the balance between action and character development is just about spot on. Yes, you can see it was written by a young person but unquestionably by a talented young person. King acknowledges this book is a classic quest and while he attributes his inspiration to Tolkien and Terry Brooks and developed the story from Browning's poem "Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came" the story felt, to me, more like it drew on the Lancelot tradition. Origins aside, it is a very good story, evenly paced with a leading character most people will find interesting. I am comfortable recommending this book to fans of the modern quest genre, it is perhaps a little too raw for the die hard Tolkien fan, Sandman Slim fans will probably enjoy it too. If the next books are up to the standard of this one, the Runaway God will have to wait until Roland reaches the tower.
A little of hard to get into I have been a stephen king fan for years, but never read the dark tower series. I had a bit of hard time getting into this in the beginning but by the end I was looking forward to the 2nd book, now I'm non the 3rd. I'm happy I decided to read these books.
This Book has a huge black Hole when you open it up! Doesn't matter if digital or paper, once you open this book you will fall into a "Doorway" that will take you to other doorways you never dreamed existed. Immediately identified with the lead character and the journey that is his obsession to complete. You will want to be with him each step through each door to his final destination! If you are a Western fan you will, or a Stephen King fan, or just need a great escape into the mind of a master story writer, start here...only KA will decide when you leave!!!
Great read This was a favorite series of one of my friends. I understand now why. While I am not a huge Stephen King fan, I do enjoy his work. This was an incredible book which I read quickly as I could not put it down. I am looking forward to reading the rest of the series.
Gift for my Mom Got this whole set for my mom for her birthday, had to order them individually since they weren't really available as a set at the time. She loves S. King and the Gunslinger series so she was ecstatic!
Love stephen king. Read these series many times over. I read the original book, 6 times, every time the next series is published, I wouldn't read the. Newest book until I reread from the beginning book first. Now I can read them from the beginning to end! Happy!
A good start to the series I have always wanted to jump into the dark tower series, but the magnitude of it always held me back. So, finally I jumped in. I had been told by many people that you "just have to get beyond the gunslinger," as if the gunslinger is some plague in the series. Maybe it is a slow start in comparison to the rest of the series; I don't know, because I'm not there yet. What I can say, is that I didn't find this book to be something I had to "get beyond." I thought it was a fun read and great starting point. It reminded me of something Leone and Cronenberg. It's filled with all of the slow brooding tension you'd find in a spaghetti western, but with the abstract nature of a Cronenberg sci-fi flick. I'm looking forward to The Drawing of the Three.
sorry, this one just didnt grab me I just want to say it's not a problem with the author. I have read It, The Stand, and Under The Dome and loved them all. I look forward to reading more of King's work. This one sadly just didn't work for me. The world just wasn't explained enough, couldn't understand the character's motiviations, some kid just gets dropped out of the sky from another dimension, high speech vs low speech (what does that even mean anyway). It got to the point I was so preoccupied figuring out wha and what everyone was that I lost track of the story I was reading. Just distracting. I got halfway through, realized I didn't remember half of what had already happened, and didn't care how it ended. I hate giving up in the middle of a book but it just would have been forced.
Excellent book!! This was an excellent book and a great step into the world that is the dark tower. Stephen king has really won me over with this story. It has an extremely unique and original feel to it. I would probably have actually given this book a 4.5 star if possible just for the mere fact that o have already read the second and am currently in the third and those books are better and definitely deserve 5 stars. But if I had not read the succeeding ones I would have gave this 5 stars.
Awesome If you are a King fan you will find this book a little different than his typical writing. If you dont get into this one - try the second novel - or give up! I have met some people that are King fans who hate the Dark Tower and vice versa - definitely worth checking out.
Great book, great series. I loved this book. The entire Dark Tower series is very good. Not your typical Stephen King stuff though. Kinda of a old west meets fantasy. The gunslingers could be compared to Knights or a different era.
One of Kings very best. This books brings us in to the world of Roland of Gilead, who's journey is going to end this fall with the release of 'The Darktower'. This book shows King at his best, the tale of a seemingly ruthless anti-hero, set in a fantasy western world that has passages to our own was just the ticket for Kings grandest and longest tale. Not to missed, if you have never read King, or don't like King's other books, give this one a try, it is refreshingly unique.
Part 1 King is the master. He has spun a world mixing the old west, Sparta and Middle Earth into a wonderful story. The writing was a little choppy but it is one of his earlier works. Looking forward to book 2
Good book. reminds me of the movie with Harrison Ford, "Cowboys and Aliens".....but certainly the book contains very little humor. To me a gunslinger's place is in the old west; while in this book the gunslinger does have his place in the old west, certain events make it seem as if this town where the gunslinger is, is a town that possess magical characters; Good book.
Enigmatic Beginning to a Promising Series I've heard a lot about this series by Stephen King, and so I was inevitably drawn to it as the Gunslinger was drawn to the Tower. The landscape at the outset of this epic is lush with interesting details and mysterious characters. The ending, not to give anything away, reminded me of 2001: A Space Odyssey. If you like a blend of science fiction, fantasy, and horror (which I do), then I recommend reading this book all the way through to prepare you for the rest in the series. I plan on starting book two today.
Stunning!!!! This is my seventh time of reading the Gunslinger series! It never gets old . I would recommend this to people that possess the gift of the "white" and a deep sense of honor that is the opitomy of Roland Deschain.
Typical Steven King I had read this before about 15 years ago and now that he has added sequels to this book, I decided to start over again and read from the start. I anticipate a epic series. I gave it only 4 stars because like I said, I had read it before and it wasn't quite as good the second time around.
must read Just pick it up and start on page one. It pulls a world over your eyes that you fall into and have no chance of waking up from. It has modern humor,action of a western, elements of fantasy and interdimentional travel, all wrapped together in an epic haunting romance that none other than Stephen king can tell. If you have never read KIng start here; If you aren't really in to his usual books- this is no typical series. Take a chance.
Good Read I'm a big King fan, but never ventured down the road of the Dark Tower series. This opening volume was an odd read at times, leaving me wondering what was happening on more than a few occasions, but it was enjoyable and led me to the second book.
The beginning I've read this book several times through its life- and mine. I always find myself lost in the universe that it creates. I expect I'll read it again somewhere down the road when the dust settles on it once more. I'm in no rush, but it's nice to know it will be waiting there for me.
A Dazzling But Flawed Masterpiece The Gunslinger is one of those books that evokes strong reactions in readers. You could simply say that people either love it or hate it but that is really too simplistic. Rather Stephen King evokes such a myriad range of different emotions with this science fiction/fantasy western that it is perfectly normal for an individual to feel both awed by its brilliance yet completely unhappy with its conclusion. I realize that is strange to say, but it is absolutely true. What else is true is that no review will ever be able to tell a prospective readers whether they will adore or despise The Gunslinger - and The Dark Tower series that follows. Quite simply, the only way to know is to put on your cowboy boots and cowboy hat and accompany Roland Deschain out into the world that has "moved on." As a reader embarks upon the quest for the Dark Tower, he finds himself following along with Roland Deschain as "the gunslinger" crosses a strange post-apocalyptic "Old West" on the tail of his most hated enemy: "the man in black." This villain was responsible for ensorcelling Roland's mother, helping to kill Roland's father, and had a hand in the destruction of everything that the gunslinger knew and loved in his world. So for years, our rugged, gun-toting hero has diligently pursued "the man in black", determined to make him pay for what he has done, and now he is tantalizingly close to finally running his quarry to ground. Yet before the epic confrontation can happen, Roland finds himself confronting crazed citizens of a small town, meeting and loving a young boy, and ultimately dealing with the specters of his own haunted past. After finishing this amazing story, I'm not ashamed to admit that I myself was one of those readers torn about my feelings for it. On one hand, I adored Roland and was desperate to learn more about his shadowy past, the why of his world's strange condition (a place so familiar to our own yet obviously alien in that alternate time stream way), and what the Dark Tower actually was. However, on the other hand, when the tale was complete and the ending digested, all I felt was . . . a big so what! Perhaps that sounds disrespectful of me. I know this is Mr. King's masterpiece, but this novel -- like the series that follows -- is a flawed masterpiece. Filled with memorable characters and masterful stories yet missing the cohesiveness of other epic series like The Lord of the Rings. The sad truth is that The Gunslinger is a grand story that lacks a real ending, which, unfortunately, is a harbinger of things to come in The Dark Tower series as a whole. With that being said, you probably wonder if I am discouraging people from setting off on this grand journey with Roland Deschain. Absolutely not! While The Gunslinger has its flaws (as does the series as a whole), there is no deny that it is an epic journey that whisks you away to another place with some of the most memorable characters in literature. And when you are done with it (Whether that be after one book or the whole series is entirely up to the individual.) it will be something you will always remember. Whether you recall it fondly or hatefully you will never know until you begin. So give this novel a try and decide for yourself if you'd like to follow the gunslinger all the way to the Dark Tower.
A good beginning As I'm sure this book's main purpose is to set up the books to come, I'm cutting it some slack. It's by no means a great, well-written book, but it does the job of introducing the world. I look forward to reading more.
Incredible At time of the writing of this review, I'm currently in book 3. Incredible and raw series that doesn't pull punches. Only thing that strikes me as odd, is that King uses many of the writing techniques he claims are the mark of an untalented and amateurish writer a plethora of times throughout the series in his "Memoir on Writing." Yet, it's incredible.
Late to the Tower I picked up a couple of books on tape (Part II, III and IV) in this series, started on III (forgot I had II), and got hooked. I back tracked to read this one and it made perfect sense to me since I was already into book IV before I read it. So far, I like IV the best.
Excellent when I first read it in the late 80s or early 90s... ...still excellent today. Reading this series is like falling, briefly, into another world. A modern classic written by a master storyteller. Even if you aren't a Stephen King fan, this series (and this book in particular) is worth reading.
Great Book, bad sales I love this book and couldn't get the second one in the series quick enough. Felt the same about the third. That's when it happened. I have been reading these on my Kindle and when I went to get the third one it is not availiable from Amazon. Are you kidding??? I can buy the paper version from them. I love the Kindle system but this may be the straw that broke the Kindle's back for me. I actually got the book for a dollar cheaper and down loaded it to my iPad. No problem at all. So Amazon it sad that you can't even support your own stuff.
Barely readable Not a very well written book. I've read a few other reviews that state that the following books help tie this into the larger universe King is trying to build here, but this book on its own just doesn't hold its own water, and is barely readable. In his forward he talks a lot about Tolkien, and the universe he created. Lord of the Rings was a deep immersive experience that held my attention because of the amazing writing and the story and characters he built. The only reason this book was readable was because of the cliffhanger nature of the entire experience. Until you reach 75% of the way through the book, you barely know more than you did in the first two pages about these characters and what in the hell kind of universe King has built. He so arrogantly steps around any and all plot/character development in the attempt to draw in readers who just want to finish the thing, like some OCD kid looking at his plate of brussels sprouts and against his will, trying to choke down the last few just to clean his plate. I've ordered the next book in the series and my opinion of that may change my view here, but stand-alone this book just wasn't good imo.
Excellent writing, but not a complete novel Great book! My only question is: What the hell does it all mean? Clearly, there are questions answered later on in the series. This "novel" is just the beginning of a long story arc. I would give it 5 stars if there were a sense of closure at the end, but there's not. In fact, the end of "The Gunslinger" blows things wide open -- so I can't really look at it as a complete novel, as much as I enjoyed it. And I DID enjoy it quite a bit. The writing is evocative. King is at his most imaginative, here: the universe is unique and thoughtful, and, like all good fictional universes, exists without having to constantly explain itself to the reader. I felt like I was dropped in the middle of something larger-than-life. There's a great build of suspense as the Gunslinger chases the man in black across the desert; weird things happen, and then even weirder things happen. The flashbacks are well-executed. So I guess my only criticism is that this novel is just the beginning of what I anticipate to be a stirring story arc, but it's not anywhere close to completed here. Better spend your money on the complete series as opposed to merely the first book; you'll get more bang for your buck.
Didn't draw me in...until the end I struggled with this book a lot, and I actually set it down for several months before finishing it. We're following the Gunslinger around this dirty, seemingly post-apocalyptic world while he chases the Man in Black. The setting and characters were so dark and just...uncomfortable with no moments of lightness or humor or anything other than death and sadness. I was also incredibly bored through the majority of the book. The world and characters were so unpleasant, that I didn't care anything about any of them, what few there were, and I sort of wanted to just put them out of their misery. Then, about 2/3 through the (blessedly short) book, he starts to catch up to the Man in Black, and things start to get a little more interesting. We start to get some answers. Ultimately, I really did not enjoy this read, BUT the end did intrigue me enough to press on. Plus, I have been assured that the rest of the books are much better with more characters.
Greatest Prologue This book is the start of the arguably greatest series of books ever written. The GunSlinger starts us on a journey with Roland, a man who is looking to find the Dark Tower to stop his world from decaying into debris. This book gives excellent detail, back story, gun smoke action and horrific underground creatures. A perfect book for Horror and Fantasy fans alike.
the beginning of the Gunslinger saga... - "All right", the gunslinger said, and then asked the world's oldest question. "Will I succeed? Will I win through?" - "If I answered that question, gunslinger, you'd kill me". - "I ought to kill you. You need killing". His hands had dropped to the worn butts of his guns. - "Those do not open doors, gunslinger; those only close them forever".
Great story! Briefly stated, I loved The Gunslinger. Very good genre-bending story that was definitely a "gateway story" to the rest of the Dark Tower series. Must read! Not the typical Stephen King horror novel.
The world Roland knew was filled with light and happiness, but as the author tells us “The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed.” The mysterious opening sentence of the Stephen King’s “The Gunslinger” draws you in and sets the tone for the rest of the book. Inspired by Robert Browning’s poem “Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came”, King weaves a masterful and epic tale. Something far more akin to mystical poetry of Browning than his other well-known works. The story centers around Roland of Gilead. We learn bits and pieces about Roland and the world via flashbacks within the story. Roland is a gunslinger, a sort of knight with six shooters instead of sword. The character definitely invokes the spirit of Clint Eastwood in style and tone. The world Roland knew was filled with light and happiness, but as the author tells us, the world has “moved on.” There are hints of a once advanced society scattered though out the landscape. Things like gas pumps, train terminals, and electric lights exist, but the present is not not unlike the romanticized American wild west. Roland is chasing after a black-cowled, mysterious, and powerful magician whom he refers to as “the man in black.” While the man in black’s origins and relationship to the gunslinger are unclear, Roland knows he has important information about “The Dark Tower.” The Dark Town is Roland’s real goal and seems to be some sort of mystical power nexus between worlds. It’s unknown just how long the chase has been going on, but Roland is gaining ground. As the chase ensues it becomes clear just how much the gunslinger is willing to sacrifice to reach his goal. I highly recommend this book. I had forgotten just how enjoyable Stephen King’s writing is and this story was particularly wonderful. The mythic and metaphorical elements of the story make it feel epic, compelling, and universal. The mysterious gaps and unexplained elements keep you turning pages. I’m generally not excited about stories that take multiple books to tell. This series clocks in a seven books and I was a bit hesitant, but after making it through the Gunslinger I can’t wait to get to the next installment.
A fantastic genre mashup I've read a lot of Stephen King in my time, and I think—despite a few young writer tics (overuse of certain words, forced descriptions of sex, etc.)—this early work is some of his strongest, most creative writing. I went in not knowing much about the Dark Tower series, and perhaps predictably, I left with more questions than answers... but that turns out not to be a bad thing. I honestly have very little clue what this series is going to be about, beyond the surface premise of the Gunslinger on his quest for the Tower, but the possibilities opened up by the five stories in The Gunslinger are myriad. I was surprised by the degree of SF that's applied to the Fantasy at work here; it struck me as something akin to the scene in the fourth Wheel of Time novel, where one of the characters goes through an artifact and ends up in a technologically advanced future/past. I get a real kick out of novels that seamlessly blend Fantasy and SF (cf. Felix Gilman's "The Half-Made World" or Christopher Priest's "Inverted World") and this one has me on the hook to read the entire series for exactly that reason. So why three stars and not four or five, given all the praise? Because it's not really a novel, and it doesn't quite hang together as one. But still, an engrossing read.
Worth reading, over and over again As someone who read the first 4 novels in this series and then waited years to read the ending, I can stay it was worth the wait! From the first line of "The Gunslinger" I was sucked into a world only Mr. King could create. By far my all-time favorite series that I have read twice and will read again. Definitely a masterpiece of fastasy!
Fantasy Western of another time & place A worthy beginning chapter of the vaulted Stephen King name. This first book in the The Dark Tower opus is a slow journey that reads quickly. Were placed in a strange world, one that is often repeated to have "moved on" from our modern world as we know it. This is a time of the last remaining Gunslinger, a knight for a different age that protected a different type of royalty. His quest is the Dark Tower, which has always been and holds the power of the universe. What that means, I have no idea. I'll learn more in book two...
got me started i had read the first book of the dark tower series years ago and never went beyond book i. now i am hooked and already on the fourth volume of this series. stephen king has a way with designing his characters so that you are invested in their lives and quests. The Gunslinger introduces us to Roland. He is a hero and an anti-hero for his time and all of the times he crosses over into. King offers us images we are familiar with and twists them so while knowing them they become strange. i enjoy this about his books.
A great beginning... if you're into this sort of thing... :) It's been so long since I first read this book that it's hard to remember my first impression of it. I have read this series many, many times since. I do remember putting it down at one point because it was slow but, loving Stephen King, I was able to get through it eventually. In the end, I actually didn't like some of the changes King made to the story in the later edition but that may be more from nostalgia than from any real complaint. I digress, so... how is this book? Slow but crucial to getting your first toe hold in Roland's world. You have to read it to understand who Roland starts out being and the reasons he becomes who does. His interaction with the people he meets, particularly Jake, form your entire base for Roland's character going forward. You actually, probably, won't like him very much. King didn't. But, if you're intrigued by the conclusion, soldier on. A nod to the rest of the series; if you don't like abstract thinking or wonky sideways worlds, don't read this series. If the only books by King you like are his fast paced, mass consumed 'horror' stories, don't read this series. It's long, it's involved and it's very weird. I feel that it was also a way for King to bleed some of the pain from his life, particularly the accident that nearly killed him, into some concrete platform from which to heal. So, that stuff is in there too. I enjoy the series in its entirety and still read it over and over, but I only recommend it to a certain type of reader.
Tough to get into but worth it in the end With so many flashbacks and little to no warning, I was completely lost in the beginning and sometimes in the middle as well. However, I did become very attached to the Gunslinger's need to find the other man and became invested in the series by the end of the book. I plan on delving into part two after taking a brief break to read another book and hopefully get Amazon gift cards to cover the cost of my next installment.
The Gunsliger This was a re-read (YES - extremely rare for me) as I recently heard there is to be a TV series based on King's sprawling story. I feel the need to repeat, for the umpteenth time, that Stephen King is one of my favorite contemporary authors. That being said, I now remember why I did not continue through the Dark Tower series. I have, excepting this endeavor, voraciously read every word (including the non-fiction Danse Macabre) that King has put to paper. I've even branched out into the writings of his son (Joe Hill) after reading their collaborations. Unfortunately, I now remember why I did not make it past the first book in the Dark Tower series. Of everything he has ever written, I just did not find the story, characters, direction of the series to my liking (which, incidentally, was amazingly disappointing to me, as I was hoping that when I initially read it, I just did not pick up on the nuances and was too young to appreciate it). I simply could not get into the story (which was amazingly surprising as I generally enjoy immensely the subject matter and potential to which the other installments in the series are headed) and I did not appreciate the characters (regardless of the fact that many pro- and antagonists King writes are not supposed to b embraced or liked). An Atheist notwithstanding, I do appreciate religious allegories (implied fiction or not - I very much enjoyed the Chronicles of Narnia, for example) as I feel they make for excellent stories. In my opinion, this was just too much over the top, even for me. I've given the book 3 stars (would have been 3.5 if it was an option), as it was not only well-written but well-fleshed out and the character development was good. Also, the rating shows I will most likely give the second book in the series a go, but we shall see where that leads me.
Eh I am generally a big King fan. I’ve read all the usuals like The Stand and The Cell and Needful Things and of course watched the movies adapted from the books. Usually, he is such a great story teller that you are pulled in immediately. A friend all but begged me to read The Dark Tower series and I have heard about it forever but knew there were many books (I read all of the GOTs books so I am no stranger to long series) but I don’t know, there just wasn’t a lot to the book. Maybe there will be more in the others? More than a guy walking across a desert and through a mountain? I just wasn’t as blown away as I expected to be. It’ll be tough to convince me to fork out the money for 7 more books if it is more of the same.
My first thought was, he lied in every word . . . The Dark Tower The Gunslinger "The Man In Black fled across the desert, and the Gunslinger followed. The desert was the apotheosis of all deserts, huge, standing to the sky for what looked like eternity in all directions." Back in the 80's, before "The Dark Tower" became the huge hit it is today, I lucked out, coming upon this jewel of modern American writing in a tiny little used book store in a tiny little town in Texas. King dreamed up the story from a reading of "Childe Roland To The Dark Tower Came" by Robert Browning, and carries all of the angst, pain an despair which fills that poem. The series centres around Roland Deschain, The Last Gunslinger, who may be a creature of myth and legend, or simply a man, as he tracks the Man In Black across a bleak and hopeless desert - a desert of reality and of the soul. "My first thought was, he lied in every word, That hoary cripple, with malicious eye Askance to watch the working of his lie On mine, and mouth scarce able to afford Suppression of the glee that pursed and scored Its edge, at one more victim gained thereby. " Robert Browning The Gunslinger immediately gripped my attention and refused to release me. Poetry, mythology, pain and loss, a searching of the mind soul and body. As a Browning fan, the concept touched me deeply. Over the years, I was thrilled every time a new Tower came out, and was never disappointed. This is King stretching himself, moving outside his "horror" boundaries, while still remaining true to his writing style in many ways. The world of the Tower is desolate, painful and digs deep into archetypes of the human soul. Is this another world, somewhere lost among the tides and times of the Universe, old beyond measure and dying? Or is this our world, old itself beyond measure, stretched thin and worn, fading into the universe with a whimper, rather than a bang. The story grows and develops over the subsequent editions, building and expanding on its mythos, its archetypes, its heart. A serialized novel of depth and power, of heartbreak and redemption, with characters unlike any others, The Tower is a blend of poetry, art and prose unlike any other. Read "The Gunslinger." Then gift your soul with the rest of the series. And think - - - what is real? Are we? Is Roland? Is the world of Roland just on the other side of our own reality? George Guidell does his normal, spectacular job as the voice of the Audible.com edition of the series. His voice, which has narrated over 900 audio books, and won two Audie Awards for Excellence in audio book narration, is perfect for the part and never deviates from its power and perfection.
Awesome book. Highly recommended for sci-fi and fantasy fans ... Awesome book. Highly recommended for sci-fi and fantasy fans alike, a really intriguing setting and good writing. I will be reading the rest of the series. I only give it four stars because at times the sheer volume of words seems a bit forced, like he was on a mission to write a 1000 page multi-volume epic series and nothing was going to stop him. Regardless, great read.
A literary mess According to King's afterword, this book started from a single sentence he wrote while still in school. He added on the rest of the 'story' (and I use the word loosely) during and between other books. It was written in pieces and tossed together when there was enough material to make a book. And it definitely shows. Leaving some things unknown and creating some psychological suspense is one thing; leaving the reader with only the barest bones of an outline is another. Why not make up the whole story yourself? You're practically there already after slogging through this mess. See Roland travel. See Roland commit mass murder. See Roland find a small boy. See Roland find railroad tracks in the middle of the desert. See them get attacked to create some pointless drama. Finally, we come to an ending. Existential philosophy is discussed. Grand things are spoken of in the vaguest possible terms. Roland experiences some powerful enchantment and ages ten years in a night. Shrug. Ho hum. He walks on as if this is something that happens every other week. Nothing is explained, no details are given, nothing connects with anything else. Admittedly this book is just a setup for the others, but it's still the most uneven mess I've seen from King (and that's really saying something, considering it has The Stand to contend with). It could have easily been trimmed down to 75-100 pages and used as an introduction to the next story. As a book in and of itself, it's an incoherent, meandering work that wouldn't have come close to being published had it been done by a first-time novelist. There are a couple connections with the following books; that's because after publishing this one, King had to scramble to make some sense out of the details he put in before. Apparently, thinking out the whole story ahead of time was just too much trouble. As for reading some of his other books (The Stand, Insomnia, Eyes of the Dragon etc.) because they're supposedly tied in with the Dark Tower: well, not they're not, exactly. Insomnia has one mention of a dream. For the others, it's because one guy (Flagg) shows up all over the place. My guess is that King made up those stories going along, came to a point where he needed a villain, and slotted in the same one rather than come up with something more original. Yawn. Let's just see if he can redeem himself in the end with this series. I remain curious.
It is written by Stephen King so you know it's got to be good. Start your quest here and follow Roland and ... This is the first book in the Dark Tower series that gets "the ball rolling". It's the story of Roland's long quest for The Tower. It is written by Stephen King so you know it's got to be good. Start your quest here and follow Roland and the people he meets and join him along the way. Read all the books about The tower and in the end, you'll be glad you did.
Great Book! It kept my attention, kept me entertained, and provoked me to by the next volume. I'm almost halfway through it and I think it's better than the first. Note, vol. 2 would be very confusing without first reading vol. 1.
His greatest work, that ultimately ties together every novel he ... Stephen King's magnum opus. His greatest work, that ultimately ties together every novel he wrote before it, and some after. The series is epic in scope, but it is still a small tale of one man's quest.
The Gunslinger Stephen King has always been one of my favorite authors. It scared me to death and The Green Mile made me weep uncontrollably. I've gone several years without reading any of his books. Excluding him from my Currently Reading list wasn't by design. I was just going through a different reading cycle. Lately, it seems that I have been reading a good bit of, let's face it, CRAP! Some of the books were enjoyable, some were painful and others were utterly forgettable - which is the worst in my opinion. I needed something to get me out of the rut I was in so I thought that Stephen wouldn't let me down. I had never read the Dark Tower series and knew that King considered it one of his great works. So, I went in to this with very high expectations. The problem with high expectations is that you are bound to be disappointed. And, I can tell you that I was disappointed for the first 50 pages. "How can I rate a King novel 2 stars? Everyone will think I am an idiot." Honestly, he would have only gotten the 2nd star because he is such a beautiful writer. It had nothing to do with the story. I thought that I might have lost my reading mojo. Time after time, I'd read several pages and realize that I remembered nothing of the story they contained. I re-read about every page in that section at least twice and some of them four times. But, I persevered. There was no way I was going to have a DNF on this one. I am so glad I pulled through. This turned out to be a 4-star book for me (and I bet if I re-read it in a year or so it could be a 5-star). Maybe you just need to be in a Stephen King kind of mood. Whatever the case, I am excited to read book 2 (next on my list) and I hope to finish the series of 7 books by the end of the year. I won't bother with a full recap of the plot. I'm not even sure I truly understand it. All you really need to know is that Roland Deschain, the gunslinger, is searching for the Dark Tower. The first book chronicles his travels over desert and mountains to find the Man in Black (a sorcerer.) He meets some very interesting (i.e. strange, disgusting, heartbreaking) characters along the way. A few of my favorite quotes: *"At nineteen, it seems to me, one has a right to be arrogant; time has usually not begun its stealthy and rotten subtractions." This is actually not from the book but from the Introduction. *"The gunslinger occasionally moaned with the wind. The stars were as indifferent to this as they were to wars, crucifixions, resurrections. This also would have pleased him." *" `Beans, beans, the musical fruit,' the raven recited, inspired. 'The more you eat, the more you toot.' " I'm sorry but you have to love such a talented author who can work this into a story. *"The gunslinger removed one of the shells from his gunbelt and twirled it in his fingers. The movement was dexterous, as flowing as oil. The shell cartwheeled effortlessly from thumb and index to index and second, to second and ring, to ring and pinky. It popped out of sight and reappeared; seemed to float briefly, then reversed. The shell walked across the gunslinger's fingers. The fingers themselves marched as his feet had marched on his last miles to this place." Like Jake, I was mesmerized. Beautiful. I've thought about this for days after reading. *"Time's the thief of memory." True that. *"I was made for light." There were a couple of things that were a little strange. The song "Hey Jude" was mentioned multiple times. I'm hoping I'll understand the connection at some point in the series. There is a reference to matricide that I don't yet understand. And, my e-book had a few pictures in random places. I could have done without them. They didn't add anything for me. Bottom line - READ THIS BOOK. Life is too short to not read Stephen King. And, you won't be nineteen forever - be arrogant while you can. It's just obnoxious at 40.
Engaging, interesting, and makes you think! I very much loved this book, I only gave it four stars instead of 5 because of the slow start. It took awhile to build up and to start to get an idea of what was going on. That, however, does not mean it was ever boring. The main character is incredibly deep, and even the side characters who make 1 chapter appearances are well thought out. The story itself keeps you guessing, asking questions both of yourself and of the story, and keeps you very engaged. It does not work as a standalone book, as it almost feels like a book long preface to the rest of the series. I can't wait to continue reading the rest of this, so far fantastic, series!
A Masterpiece, To Say The Least Believe it or not, this was my first Stephen King novel (which isn't that unbelievable, until you take into account I finished it little more than two weeks ago), and I was blown away. Though I have no previous references by which to compare this book to, I must say, King's writing style is mysteriously descriptive and leaves little to the imagination; while some authors overly describe something and take away from the credibility of the book, and while King does describe things in great detail, he does it in a way that doesn't bore you, but instead makes the characters and the like all the more imaginable. Roland the gunslinger, the main character and the namesake of this book, seems very human in what he does, having no real outstanding talents (besides his gunslinging, of course), and a lot of readers can relate to his feelings of purposeless in a world gone to hell. Another interesting part of the book is the various cultural nods made to our own society; for example, there are several references to The Beatles' hit "Hey Jude" being played on a ragtime piano somewhere off in the distance, and a story that Jake tells to the gunslinger creates a vague description of New York City and...well, I've said too much already. Though some may find those references tacky and overtly allegorical, the book doesn't really seem intent on making the moral state of the world look like [...], like many allegorical authors enjoy doing. But an overall message is still somewhat present in all the fantasy and western-style action displayed in this book. Also, the book is relatively short (being only 300 pages), so it's ideal for those who don't enjoy unnecessarily long reads (although I must warn you, the rest of the books in the series don't follow this example; the final book is no less than 900 pages). Lastly, I would have never discovered this book in the time I did without the help of Demons & Wizards, a power metal band whose most recent effort focused heavily on the Dark Tower series for its lyrics. I won't get into a lot of detail about the band itself here, but if you're interested in hearing this band convey their ideas about the series and various other fantastic viewpoints (including an interesting analysis of the Wicked Witch's death in the Wizard of Oz), then look them up. Overall, this book has become one of my favorites, and I hope to find the same excitement in the other six books in the series (I've already begun to read the second installment, and it's got me hooked). Whether you're a avid King fan or a newcomer to his unique writings, this book has something to offer to everyone. I won't guarantee you'll like it, but it will definitely pique your interest one way or another. 10/10
A good book but it could have had more action I read this book after hearing that this was the universe to which all of Stephen Kings other universes were connected to and that in a way this was Stephen Kings central Universe. While this was true I kind of over expected what it was the book was about. What I expected out of was a western story with a Clint Eastwood style character which in plenty of ways it was, I kind of expected a young man in his thirties who had little emotion rarely said much except to ask questions and had the kind of amazing superhuman reflexes that allowed him to pull out a gun in a split second and had sharp enough eyes to quickly take in his surroundings. I realized it was a sort of futuristic western and its main character could quickly pull out a gun and his eyes were sharp I also realized he wasn't as young as I had expected him to be. Though his age really made little difference. The story itself was good and you start to wonder about Roland's world and some of its connections to Stephen Kings other books the book could have had a bit more action. I'm not usually an action fanatic but I did expect some more action when the main character was packing two western style pistols. But there are some good action scenes and the story does hook you while you read it and after you read it. The characters are done well enough and Roland's almost Fatherlike love for Jake the boy he meets at the way station is well done. But Roland's journey to the Dark Tower and his willingness to give up everything to get to it is one of his more defining emotions especially close to the end. The end however is the part where I expected some sort of battle between Roland and the Man In Black but instead they had a sort of conversation where they discussed the tower and other issues. In the end however Roland learns that he will have to "draw" three people from another world into his to aid him in his quest. Even though I thought it could have used more action it still ended up being a good book and an enjoyable read and I would highly advise people read it as it's quite entertaining in many ways. All in all a good book.
Truly underrated, underappreciated; a true underdog story "The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed." I remember buying a few books from the book store: Swan Song, Earth Abides and The Dark Tower. I was pumped to read all of them, so sort of as a joke, I read the first sentences of each novel to my girlfriend and asked her which was the best. Of course the best was from The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger. It's funny because Stephen King also admits that was one of the best lines he'd ever written; if not the best line beginning a novel. There's just so much power in that sentence that it's repeated at least four times in the series in difference forms. We begin as the sentence says. The Gunslinger is following the man in black; the reason why, we don't know. But who needs to know? A Gunslinger is reason personified. In the story, we don't learn that much about who Roland is. He doesn't talk that much, but his quick hand makes up for what his mouth doesn't say; he isn't real friendly, but his presence is powerful, Clint Eastwood-esque. The tale doesn't have much plot - it just is a journey with tales interwoven throughout. He tells a tale to man named Brown of his mishappenings in a place called Tull; then he finds a boy named Jake at a Way Station in the middle of no where - the boy remembers nothing, therefore Roland hypnotizes the boy and sees how he got there - what he sees, he doesn't fully understand, but we do. Then they travel together, following the man in black. It's very simple and straight forward. The Gunslinger is the best written Stephen King story to date; you could really tell he loved what he was writing and the story loved surging through his fingertips. It was like reading a poem; in fact, the series is loosely based off from Robert Browning's 'Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came' which is a long poem - and I gotta say that their is swagger and style to the first installment to this mega series that reads much like a poem. It's not action packed; it's not a Stephen King-esque horror novel; it is, in many ways, beyond Stephen King. And if you read the series, you'll understand (quite literally, you'll understand). The best way of describing this novel is an exact combination of Cormac McCarthy (No Country For Old Men, The Road) and Richard Matheson (Hell House, I Am Legend). Still to this day this is the best written fiction novel that I have read and is the best in the series. Don't read it if you're looking for cheap thrills; read it if literature means something to you.

My favorite Dark Tower book Although most seem to disagree, this one is definitely my favorite Dark Tower book. As King discusses in the introduction, it was inspired by Sergio Leone's "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" and J.R.R. Tolkien's "The Lord of the Rings". From reading this book that much is clear, but he seems to insert far more Leone than Tolkien. It's basically a western adventure set in a fantasy land with a few horror elements thrown in for good measure (e.g. the Way Station scene). The best part is the characterization. Roland reminds me of Clint Eastwood's rougher roles. He's a good man, stern, quiet, and absolutely merciless. Given that he is the hero of the novel, you'll find it shocking how many partially-innocent people he puts six feet under in order to meet his goal. That goal is simply summarized in the first line of the novel: "The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed". The reasoning isn't explained in too much detailed and much of the background is saved for later books. This doesn't matter too much since the joy in reading this is, in addition to the characterization, the feeling of adventure. Also, the more enigmatic the man in black is, the more fearsome he becomes. This novel, though essentially an early work of King's, mixes the best of old King and new King. Older King was raw with great storytelling, but the language was a bit crude. As he got older he was able to manipulate words with much greater ease and eloquency, but his imagination suffered as did his willingness to cross lines (though a few lines were crossed in Dreamcatcher). This book mixes the creativeness of his early work with the intellectual, voluble language of his later work. However, some of the language comes off as a bit pretentious but only on occasions. Of note, the writing style changed a bit in later volumes and reminds one of older King more than this volume did. The story, however simple it may seem at this point (the complexity amps up in later volumes), is very interesting, his descriptions are simply perfect, and the language is King at his optimum. Don't hesitate to pick this one up.
as compelling as any fiction I've read I won't spoil the plot of this book one bit-- one of the most important elements to the storyline is the building tension and lack of general backstory. All you know in the beginning is that chasing the Man in Black is the only thing the Gunslinger has left in life, and that is all you should know before you read the book. King does an excellent job of making an intriguing central character. The chivalric ideals of the knight and the fascination of the Old West are melded in the Gunslinger but he remains a believable character. He may embody an ideal but he is not better for it. He'll sacrifice anything to reach his goal but the book focuses rather on the horror of actually upholding that kind of conviction rather than the virtue. He's a gripping character because despite his dedication, all he's done is pay the price and never reaped a reward. His obsession has made him cold, hard, and ruthless. he seeks to do the ultimate good but is destroying his humanity in the process. He's a sad, frightening, but inspiring character-- the best one Stephen King has ever created. It is appropriate that King's writing career began with him and will most likely come to a close with him. The setting makes the story even more of a good read. The haunting wasteland the Gunslinger inhabits is a world that has come apart at the seams. This in itself would not be terribly interesting, but King weaves hints of what the world once was into the story, and the echoes of a brighter past snag the reader like a hook. Decay has conquered all, even love, in the world of the Gunslinger, but his presence makes it difficult to accept. The world he once knew slowly unfolds throughout the book as the plot develops, and King keeps the reader interested. JRR Tolkien was once asked why he didn't write more about the events of the Second Age that set the stage for his Lord of the Rings series. He answered that the ruins of the old world the LOTR characters journeyed through were magical in their forgotten glory. If you knew everything about them, their inherent beautiful sadness would be somewhat lessened and less interesting. King has made great use of that intangible "magical" factor in the Dark Tower series. The ruins of the Gunslinger's world cry out to the reader, but all that's left is the memory of what was once beautiful in the Gunslinger himself-- and the quest afoot to put things right again. Start traveling with the Gunslinger and you'll never want to stop hearing all about him and his quest.
Embodiment of the Oral Tradion I travel quite alot over the road, so I have been listening to audio books for about ten years. Audio books are a great way to ward off sleep and keep you entertained while enduring the tedium of travel. I was first introduced to Roland Deschain in the short story included in "Everything's Eventual". I remember thinking it was strange and didn't fit with anything that Stephen King had ever wrote, but I was immediately interested. I'm not a big Stephen King fan but have enjoyed everything of his I've read. After finishing "Everything's Eventual" I went in search of King's additional writings about the Gunslinger. To my delight I found that the final installment of the series had just recently come out in audio format, good. It was quite tome, in audio book format it was 29 hours long with 24 cd's, even better. Also there were seven volumes in the series, that was the best part. Did I mention I drive alot. Well I figured that I better start at the begining and was somewhat disappointed to find the first installment was only 7 hours long, but no matter there were six others and judging from their girth I was going to have a lot to listen to for the foreseeable future. Never did I suspect what that future held. The Dark Tower series is at once strange and compeling. After you get past the initial difficulties with language and setting, the people of Roland's time speak with a strange dialect and live in a world that at once is and is not our own, you become curious and drawn in to the narrative. This series is absolutely amazing in audio format. The oral tradition of sitting around the fire listening to stories told over generations is clearly embodied in this work. The mythical story of the Gunslingers and Roland Deschain draws you in so completely that I've missed exits on the highway and sat outside of my house after driving many hours to hear what happens next. I own over fifty audio books but this series is the ultimate example of the genre. Incidentally, the entire series took me over a year to listen to, but the characters are so mesmerizing that even today, two years after completing the series, I still think about them. And as Stephen King says all of his stories end here, so, if your a King fan don't be surprised at the appearance of characters from his other works. I'm not a King expert but I imagine some of his most enigmatic characters are the ones we meet during Roland's quest. The ones with which he has some unfinished business. For anyone that has not been exposed to audio books or has snubbed their nose at the thought of being read to, give "The Gunslinger" a chance. "Death but not for you Gunslinger"
The start of Stephen King's best work I debated whether to give this book 4 or 5 stars. On one hand it is not the strongest book in the series, on the other hand the story opens what I consider the greatest peice of fiction told in at least the last 50 years. This series, much like all of King's work, lacks much in the way of deaper meaning. It is just a story. That said it is a brilliant story. These seven books contain the best character development I have ever seen from any writer. The development of Roland through the series is seamless. The change is so subtle through the first book taht I have heard people call him shallow. And in fairness, I can see where they are coming from. Roland doesn't change at nice neat critical points set up in the plot. He changes slowly with time. As you see more of his character you recognize not only the changes in him but also the depth and complexity of his character. As you read, keep in mind that this entire book is only 1/7th of the story. Each book blends into the next leaving very little wrapped up. I would suggest making sure you have the second book (Drawing of the Three) ready to pick up as soon as you are done with this one. When I picked up these books onyl the first three were released and it irked me to no end to have to wait so long between books with so much left up in the air. Unlike most fantasy books, there is no divine protection for the main characters. Understand that people you like in the story can easily die or get maimed. If you have read and enjoyed anything else by Stephen King you will want to read this series. Many of his other works revolve around the axis of the Dark Tower. If you are looking into Stephen King's work for the first time there is no where better to start.
A great book that only the imagination of Stephen King could produce!The star of the show is Roland...a cowboy of sorts This is a beautifully written book.The good thing about this book is that it is fast paced and is highly fascinating.It is not the usual book you would pick up and read.This book would make you want to read all the sequels,for one simple reason.And that is that this book doesn't give us a clue as to what the dark tower is.But it still gives us hope as to what is yet to come.In this book Stephen King combines "clint eastwood" with "Tolkien" to give you a magnificent abnormal cowboy,Roland. This book doesn't explain who Roland is,really...it kind of drops you into a story that is already happening,and gives you a bit of the backstory as you go on.But not all of it...just enough to satisfy your hunger.And draw you on inexorably forward. The scene in Tull(a place in the story)gives you insight into the gunslinger's psyche,which is why it is surprising that he develops such strong feelings toward Jake(a character in the story)later on.However,you never doubt that it is the Tower that is Roland's highest priority,so you know what he will chose toward the end of the book. The final scene,when Roland finally catches the man in black(some of his enemies),is both a little anticlimatic(you expect there to be a much more violent encounter)and very deep(you learn things that you will not understand until they are revealed in several books later).Also,you get a good look into the working of Roland's world..and all worlds..and you see how King has drawn lines between som many of his books and is drawing them together into a web of interconnected stories. It is truly an incredible beginning to an incredible tale. This interesting book introduces most of the characters that will be with Roland throughout his quest for the DARK TOWER. It is well paced and doesn't go as in depth with the characters as some of his other books do.However,it does its job very well...which is to introduce the characters,give you some insight into them,foreshadow what they may be capable of(under the circumstances),and begin the delicate task of weaving them together.It also does a pretty good job of explaining the concept of KA and making you wonder if coincidences really exixt,or if it is all part of some great plan... I would not advise you to rush through this book.They are details that will become relevant later in the story. They are so many things(I guarantee you)that you would not understand until you read the others.So have a little patience. This book(a good way to put it)I would consider to be only an introduction.The real story starts from part 3-the wastelands.Until you reach that book,you have to read the first two and just keep the basic facts in your mind until the time comes in the later books to understand it... This is a very easy yet difficult review to write.Because I guess that is just the way it is. Because normally a Stephen King review/Book would involve a normal "world" like ours with normal people who are tortured in his stories! But in this book STEPHEN KING creates a whole new world,which I am giving you a formal invitaion to Enter.And do so with the utmost importance,because STEPHEN KING know no mercy! ..........enjoy...Nigel
Best King I've ever read I'm not a big fan of Stephen King-- as far as I'm concerned, he's one of the most inconsistent authors around. Books like "The Gunslinger," however, show him to be an undeniable talent. The dreamlike and bizarre world the gunslinger, Roland, inhabits is one of the more original creations I've ever heard of. For example, it begins like a Western: A man with no name enters a small one-street, inbred town in the middle of the desert. You know that something is weird, though, when the tune being played on the piano in the saloon is "Hey Jude" in ragtime. The book is essentially four short stories, each of them totally bizarre, and completely enveloping. There are recommendation below to skip this book, and start at "The Drawing of the Three." DO NOT DO THIS! I have yet to finish DOTT, but it does not in any way establish the world of the gunslinger, nor does it show exactly how sad, lonely and ruthless the gunslinger is. This is not a book with a clear narrative-- it is more about setting up a world and an enigmatic character. You won't finish the book and be at all clear on what has just happened, which makes it all the more intriguing. I must say, however, that the second book has, thus far, been a disappointment. I haven't finished it yet, however, and even if it is bad, I'll still read the rest of the series, simply because I so enjoyed this first book. By the way, I think the reason that some people didn't like this book is because most King books follow a fairly clear narrative, which this one does not. Don't go into it expecting a plot; if you do, you're sure to be disappointed. But if you don't feel that books *need* a clear plot, then get this one. You won't be disappointed.
Very enjoyable! It's not your typical Stephen King novel but it's still a great read. I probably enjoyed it more since I read it along with the audio version in my Kindle. I like the mystery of the gunslinger's past and the curiosity of his future.
As grand as I’d remembered. I started reading The Darktower when I was a young man, and at the time, only half of the books had been written. Reading “The Gunslinger” again has lit the fire in my heart for the story of Roland, his ka-tet, and the quest for the infinity of the Tower. As the author points out, the writing is a little clunky, but the story is amazing and it is an excellent investment. I highly recommend this work.
Stephen King's first My son suggested that I read this novel; It might be me but I didn't like the way it went back in time and forward in time. For me it was very confusing. I don't think I will read any more of his novels. Many of my son's friends told me that it was so great, but not for me. Sorry.
Not your Father's Western. I first read this book back in the eighties when it came out. I was not into westerns (which is what I thought this was when I first picked it up - it's not) but I was very into Stephen King (who wasn't after the stand?) So, I gave it a shot and was immediately hooked. Then I waited for the next one, read it and then the next one, read it, and then NOTHING for years. I only found out that he finished the series about a month ago. So now I have started all over and just finished the gunslinger. The story has 3 main characters. The Gunslinger (Roland) the Man in Black (the sorcerer) and Jake (the lost boy). We follow Roland on his pursuit of the man in black and learn some of Roland's back story as we go. We learn right away that the world has moved on and he is the last of the gunslingers from Galien - where and when that is, is left up to one's imagination. King never says what year it is or why everything is so bleak and mutated - but one can only imagine that there was some sort of apocalypse that he has not fully clarified to us - which is ok because he drops little hints and then sort of lets your imagination fill in the blanks. The only thing that truly matters is catching up with the man in black who seems to always be just a little ahead of Roland. During Roland's travels we meet Jake and fall hard for him as he is so innocent. He is from the future, or maybe the past - you just can't be sure because time is very warped in this story - but his character is very endearing and you can't help falling in love with him. Roland on the other hand is no innocent. He is in pursuit of the black tower and must catch up with the man in black no matter what it takes.
Just OK I was hoping for better. I'm not a Stephen King fan or anything, so I didn't know what to expect. I felt it was kind of slow going with lots of references to things that are never explained. It finally got a little interesting toward the last quarter of the book, but it just stopped. This book does not stand alone at all, but I'm willing to keep going and see what the rest of the series has to offer.
Not impressed My favorite part of the book was the thoughtful and candid introduction by King, "On Being Nineteen." It's downhill from there. Being in between books by Rothfuss, Abercrombie and Martin I grabbed this thinking it might measure up. Not even close. I'm not going to say it's awful, and was a step up from the last Sci Fi book I read, Neal Ambrose's Snow Crash. But I found myself dreading the book, which is not the relationship I like to have with what I'm reading. It seemed clear that King wrote this at an annoying age, when we all think we know everything and are the deepest souls in the world. Much of the story sounds like a first year college student, just discovering mushrooms, blabbing on about the infinity of the universe. I'd love to know King's honest opinion of this book. I'd be proud of it for sure, but would probably provide an intro later in life, like he did, making sure to explain that I wrote it at 19.
Happy early Birthday, Sis...9/6/88 My now deceased brother had written this in the front cover of the book that I pulled from a tub of books in the basement recently. I felt bad. I had tried to get through this book back then, but couldn't. I have read all of Stephen King's books over the last 30+ years except the Dark Tower series. My husband has read the whole series. So the remaining books in the series were there as well. I decided to try again. This book is difficult to read...strange verbiage, not much of a plot. I persevered and after reading the 2nd book was so glad I did. It's much easier to read and the plot gets much better. Much more "Stephen Kingish". I'm getting ready to start the 3rd book and am excited about it. So, give this one a go, get through it, and enjoy the rest as I plan to do. It's not too late.
A good start to an epic saga For those new to The Dark Tower series (myself being one of them), Stephen King has revised this first part of the series, The Gunslinger, a few years back so it'd blend in better with the rest of the series. I picked up The Gunslinger a couple times previously but wasn't too enthralled with it - but this time I found myself getting hooked in and am now hoping to read every book of the series. While The Gunslinger is known for being a lesser novel than the 2 that follow it (The Drawing Of Three and The Waste Lands), it's a good introduction into the world of Roland as he follows The Man In Black. The universe King has created here is very intriguing, while being labeled a fantasy The Gunslinger fits in beautifully with the western genre also filled with plenty of horror and mystery. It's a pretty fast read, and not one minute after I finished it I went ahead and bought the next 3 books in the series because I knew I had to stick with it to see where it all was heading. Put simply, I now understand why so many think this is Stephen King's greatest work, and hope this encourages more people to give this a chance.
Revised and re-visited - but my first time around. I know I am decades behind the times in reading this book now, and quite possibly this review won't matter to many of you for that reason. But nevertheless I will put my 2 cents into the pot. A client recommended this book to me and peaked my interest - but not so much that I wanted to buy it. Tried to find a copy at several local libraries but not easily available. So I forked over some bucks for a Kindle download. Glad I did. At first I was sceptical - I've never been a fan of westerns, and the idea of a western themed fantasy seemed kind of like chocolate covered pickles. In fact until about a year ago, I wasn't much of a fan of Mr. King. Years ago, I read Pet Cemetary, at a point in my life that some of the sub-themes disagreed with my religious world view in a way that turned me off. But last year, on a whim, I picked up a used copy of one of his short story collections at a thrift shop (Everything's Eventual) and was blown away by his varied and thought provoking writing style. So, anyway, I gave this book a shot and I am very glad I did. I would describe it as an odd blend of fantasy, science fiction, and westerns (but not much of the latter - mostly the setting). In some ways this book reminds me of the Darkover series - guns and magic co-exist - but not your straightforward magic. A little bit of Carlos Castenada and/or Philip K. Dick for spice. The diction takes a little getting used to - but not annoyingly so. And disclaimer - I have only read the first book of a long series. In short I do recommend it, and am looking forward to reading the next volume.
That was confusing… but I think I liked it… 3.5/5 Rating Originally posted at https://mylifemybooksmyescape.wordpress.com/2015/10/30/book-review-the-gunslinger-the-dark-tower-1-by-stephen-king/ So yeah... that was a tad bit confusing... The story starts with the gunslinger wandering alone in the desert for the man in black. Who the gunslinger is? We don't know. Where this desert is? We don't know. Who the man is black is? We don't know. Traveling across the desert he meets a dweller with a pet raven and inquires if he has seen the man in black - which he has. While talking and eating with the dweller, the gunslinger tell hims of the town of Tull; the girl by name of Allie that he met there, the dead-man by the name of Norm, and the horrors and the incident that happened there before he came here. After his brief time with the dweller, the gunslinger sets off again in search of the man in black. This time he meets a young boy. Why the boy is here? We don't really know. How the boy got here? We don't really know. Where/When the boy is from? It is not really clear. As the gunslinger takes the boy with him in his travels, he tells the boy stories of life and comings of age. (Which really raises oh so many more questions). Together they close the gap on the man in black, encountering demons and monsters. At the end, the gunslinger will face a major decision if wants to finally kill the man in black. After finishing the book: who the gunslinger is? I'm still not one hundred percent sure. Who the man is black is? I think I have a rough idea. Where we are? It's some type of post-apocalyptic settings (that's the best I can do). When we are? I haven't a clue. How the gunslinger get here? Haven't a clue. And what the Dark Tower is? Apparently it's a tower that something (for lack of spoilers), but really... I still haven't a clue. In summary, you can say that I have almost no idea what is going on! XD BUT! I am very comfortable with where we are after the first book. I heard that this novel could be very confusing to follow along. I completely agree. Not confusing with concepts presented (except for maybe the end), but where we are in context to the rest of the story. You ever sit down to watch a movie, and miss the first 30 minutes where it does all the character and plot introductions? You can still follow along with what is happening now, but there are names, places, and events that are brought up from earlier that you feel you should know. And while you do understand what is happening right here, right now, because you missed the intro you don't really have an idea of where everything is headed until you reach the end of movie. Despite all this, I really did enjoy the novel. Yes there are questions and confusion here, but for me personally, the amount questions excites me to think that series will have so much to say! And that confusion did not frustrate, but created a yearning (I like that word. I need to use it more) in me, to find out why. Wherever we are, I found it fascinating. It's a very dark, bleak, depressing, set in this post-apocalyptic setting. Add that together with the gunslinger and boy traveling together, it has a real The Road feel to it. The gunslinger himself I found to be a mysterious character. After learning more about him in the story, I have even more questions about his origins and feel I know even less about him. The one big question I had been struggling with from start was if he was a good guy or bad guy? Are we looking at a story of the hero or anti-hero? To me, it feels kind of like a "hero" that has fallen and is now on a quest for vengeance. Whatever it is though, I'm intrigued. The ending was my favorite part. Even though it was probably the weirdest thing ever, what it was talking about and saying that the Dark Tower was, I though it was the coolest thing, and cannot wait to keep reading this series. I also felt the most comfortable there. The explanation was definitely way out there, and raised even more question, but the fact that something was actually being explained for once, was an incredible comfort. Other readers, and even King himself, have said that you need to trust him about this first book, and that things will make sense and get good in The Drawing of the Three. Regardless of who the author was, I would still continue reading to the next book, but knowing that this series is by King, it is a great to relief to know that all these questions will be explained in time. 3.5/5 Rating -DJ
Excellent Fable for Modern Times The gunslinger, Roland, moves through a world that has "moved on." This is not a typical gunslinger story a la spaghetti western or Louis Lamour; it is a story of a quest, more of a knight's tale of morality, adventure and hardship. Most importantly, it is the first door to a fascinating series of stories making up the Dark Tower series by Stephen King. This series is, in my opinion, his best work, and "The Gunslinger" is the first in the series. Each of the characters in "The Gunslinger" is well established and fully created. The situations encountered by them draw you into their individual stories, and you also grasp their importance in Roland's quest, to a point. There is much foreshadowing, although you won't know this until you read the subsequent novels in the series. The book stands well on its own, although you will be drawn to continuing with Roalnd's quest in the following novels. After all, Ka will lead you to finishing the series if you are a knight at heart. This book has it all, interesting characters, a fascinating plot, creative setting, and a cast of characters you can both identify with at some level and really care about as you travel with Roland on his quest for the Dark Tower. The CD version is particularly good for listening to as you travel or just sit and enjoy the creative story-telling skills of Stephen King. Although George Guidall's performance in reading "The Gunslinger" is very good, I would have preferred hearing Frank Muller, who reads subsequent novels in the series.
Post apocolytic bliss! This book turned me into a serious Stephen King fan. King can write himself out of anything! When you reach the end of this first book, you can't possibly imagine where he'll go...and then you start the next book and are stunned and drawn in once again. He is the master. I love (and hate) his characters and know them like old friends. Intricate and creative. Go for it!
Enjoyed it more than I thought I would I tried reading this as a teen. Couldn't get into it. I tried again in my early twenties. I thought it was okay but only got about 25% in before falling off of it. This time I decided I was sticking with it and I'm glad I did. On it's own it's a decent book, but what I'm really excited about is being able to move forward into the series.
A unique beginning to the Dark Tower The Gunslinger--actually a series of distinct short stories--envelopes the reader in its richly crafted world and its incredibly absorbing characters. The book draws its strength from its odd, strangely disjointed feel. We know next to nothing about the gunslinger himself, and even less about the strange world we find ourselves in. But half the fun of this book is reveling in the confusing mirage of the gunslinger's desert dystopia, journeying and discovering everything at the same pace as the gunslinger himself in a world where everything is not quite as it seems. It is a hazy world, only dimly lit by the light of reason, yet at the same time bound together by the passions and powers of its stunningly human inhabitants. The whole book is tied together with a feeling of haunting, mesmeric urgency. "The Man in Black fled across the desert, and the Gunslinger followed", the story begins, and after the initial one-two punch of the opening tale, the book never lets go. In many ways this book is incredibly unorthodox, and I think most readers will either love it or hate it. But if you're like me, and this kind of dark pseudo-fantasy appeals to you, you will utterly lose yourself in this book and its sequels. At times you may be confused, bewildered by the strange world and even stranger characters. But in the end, like the Gunslinger himself, the Dark Tower will have you under its spell as you revel in King's dusty dream-world of The Gunslinger.
absolutely mindblowing!!!! I have always been a fan of Stephen King. I was a avid reader of his scary stories, most notable favs of mine, Salem's Lot, Firestarter and The Shining. I could never get enough of his tales and you could see through reading his novels he was influence by the likes of storytellers, Alfred Hitchcock and (the grandfather) H.P. Lovecraft. However, the day I purchased the Dark Tower, I was not prepared for the story that would unfold. The infamous line that starts this incredible tale of Urban Fantasy boarding Scifi, 'the man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed.'- should go down in history as one of the most powerful beginning storylines in literature. I am not a fan of the graphic novel because the novel alone brings so many incredible and outlandish visual to the minds eye as you read the text. As a artist, writer and avid reader, I was allowed to unleash my imagination to the farthest reaches of the cosmos reading the Dark Tower. The tale is so enthralling, that the chase becomes almost secondary because of the interesting characters the gunslinger meets along the way. The man in black is the gunslinger Rolands what professor Moriarty was to Sherlock Holmes. He is an intriguing antagonist or maybe he is a cataylst. Almost giving the main a reason to exist. As much as I love Stephen King's scary stories but once I began reading The Dark Tower series, he had me at- The man in black. I was hooked since then and I have never looked back.
S'ok, but it's basically a foundation chore for the books to come I agree with others, that this is a somewhat tedious thing you have to get through to get to the next books. I'm most of the way through The Drawing of the Three and it's way, way fun. The Gunslinger sets that (and presumably the other books) up, but I didn't really enjoy it, though it was ok (thus three stars). It tends strongly towards the parts of Cormack McCarthy's work that I don't really dig (the middle of The Crossing, huge swaths of Blood Meridian), where the protagonist is wandering in the wilderness, having epiphanies and running low on water, interspersed with random moments of violence. That said, there are interesting parts, the groundwork is necessary, and I think the rest of the books are going to be a rollicking good time.
In the Beginning I've read around 40 of King's novels, including this one back in high school. After the news of the upcoming film in 2017, I attempted to pick up where I'd left off with Book IV, Wizard and Glass. However, I found I needed to go back to the beginning to refresh myself on the story. This book has always stood out in my memory as being stranger than most Stephen King books. It's dreamier, more surreal. Most of the narrative is almost short stories, or rather, a story within a story within a story. You have to pay attention to keep the thread. Overall, it's a great intro and keeps you on your toes. The narrator does a great job as well. The books that follow are more streamlined.
The beginning of a true cult classic series I first read this over 20 years ago, and shamefully never carried on to read the rest of the series. It was always in the back of my mind though, so I finally got round to re-starting, and re-reading The Dark Tower. I loved it the first time through for the evocative lone figure crossing desert motif. This sort of imagery has been heavily borrowed before and after and I still love it. This is a five star book because it’s fearlessly original, mixes things up in daring ways and is truly affecting and awe inspiring for a work of high fantasy. What I really liked on second reading was the beautiful use of language that really shows the ability of Stephen King early in his career. I could happily read it a third time right now, but it inspired me to start writing myself so time is precious. My only reservation is the daunting size of the rest of the story. I’d recommend this to any fan of sci-fi, fantasy, westerns, post apocalyptic, dystopian, mystical and epic adventure art. Songwriters and painters should all read this. As I discovered years ago, this volume is satisfying buy itself, having more to look forward to is awesome.
Stick with it! This is a hard series to get going with, but I promise if you stick through half way of book one, you won't be disappointed. Mr. King outdid himself with this series, so much so that I have owned book 7 since it's release & could not let myself read it because I didn't want my little ka tet to be shelved forever...the power of Mr. Kings writing to me has always been his characters. His best works come from letting his readers know his characters inside & out, & this series is very very strong in that regard. So good, I've re-read each book in the whole series all over again with each new release. I even purchased an e-reader this time because books 1 thru 6 were falling apart. Lol. If Im your faithful reader Mr. King, you are indeed my faithful storyteller, able to capture my imagination & take it on the ride of my life in splendid fashion! im1krazeekat@gmail.com
Here for the writing, lukewarm about everything else. I’ve had several people recommend The Dark Tower series to me, so I figured that since there’s an adaptation in the works, it’s time to finally read it. While it’s not what I normally read, there were certain aspects of it that I enjoyed, and I plan to continue reading the rest of the series. I spent a lot of time being confused about what was happening in the story – my usual response to thrillers, admittedly. This threw me off a bit. I also had a hard time because so much of it is spent in Roland’s head – there are occasional appearances from other characters, but mostly it’s all Roland. I did enjoy how atmospheric the book was, though. King did an excellent job immersing us in Roland’s world from the start. I was actually in awe of this aspect of the book, since he constructs the setting so effortlessly. He doesn’t spend a ton of time describing it like in some of the other fantasy series I’ve read – instead it unfolds in front of us as we follow Roland on his journey through the desert without us even realizing what’s happening. The writing is really what kept me going here.
My Review The Gunslinger was a pretty darn good novel that I found very difficult to put down. From the very first line, which I consider to be among the best in literature, King hooks his reader and begins the long task of reeling the reader in all of the way along the beam to the Dark Tower. The only way that this novel fails in any regard is that, from the beginning, this is obviously a set-up novel for much more to come and as such it feels at times (very few times, but there none-the-less) that King forces the story along at a hell-bent pace to get things moving on towards the next installment in the tale. I think that due to the pacing of the rest of the novel, that the end suffers a bit as it slows things down again and then goes a bit off track. The final confrontation, to me, was a bit disappointing, but things quickly move forward and we are left eagerly awaiting The Drawing of the Three. It's been a LONG time since I first read this novel and that was in it's original form. I don't really remember well enough to be able to tell what was added or changed, but for the most part, I think that the story was much more clear and concise and there was a lot less confusion than when I read it the first time. On the other hand, there were passages and events in the book that I remember as clearly as if I had read them yesterday, so the original version was extremely powerful in it's own right. The one thing that I missed while reading the revised and expanded edition were the beautiful full-color illustrations. However, I have the original trade paperback version, so I could flip through from time to time and catch up on the artwork that I had missed. One last note on this edition, I found it odd that with all of the changes and edits that were made, there is still on character that is referred to by two names without really clarifying that it is indeed the same person. I guess Allie could be a nickname for Alice, but when the name Alice is introduced it's well after we've been dealing with the character and I thought that King was talking about a different character for a bit.
Great read King drew me right into the story from the start. I did read this book about 20 years ago but wanted to start over and go through the entire series. It was just as exciting as the first time I read it. Can't wait to start the second book. This was my first book on the kindle and I really enjoyed it. Format was good and I didn't notice any typos or other errors.
Hooked Me Immediately... **********SPOILERS TOWARDS THE END OF THE REVIEW*************** I absolutely loved this book, I read the revised version (will be going back and reading the original book after I'm done with the entire series). King is a genius, I love the way he writes and his voice comes through so strong that you can't help but fall completely into the world he takes you to. Roland is an amazing MC. At first he comes across as a very simple, one note character but very quickly you learn that he's actually this complex multilayered character. The rest of the characters in the book range from whimsical to outright bizarre and the slow moving mutants have haunted my dreams more than once. I love how King blends Western, Fantasy and this epic tale that really reminds me of one of the old quest tales. Almost like something you'd find in the stable of an Arthurian collection. Everyone kept telling me to give the series a chance and to just push past the first book to get to the second book because that's the one that would hook me into the series but I was hooked far before the end of the Gunslinger. I think my only complaint with the book would be the beginning of the end. It felt like there should have been a bigger climax and I was pretty mad that Roland let Jake die in order to follow his obsession/destiny but it's pretty clear he loves Jake and it seems like Roland doesn't love easily so hopefully future books will further address what happened or maybe (fingers crossed) Jake will show back up. His final words indicated that maybe that could happen. After the initial disappointment of no big show down between The Man in Black and Roland I really got into the ending. You get a glimpse that there's so much more intricacy coming that I couldn't wait to start the next one.
I'll Need to Read it Again... I listened to the book while driving, so I may not have been as attentive as I could have been, but I felt a lot of detail was lost on me. It seemed very confusing at times. I was able to follow the second half of the book, but the beginning was tough. Decent story overall. Getting the next one now.
Good book to suck you in to the series The thing that caught my eye in the bookstore was the cover. I love Stephen King stories that aren't horror so I was tempted to pick it up. Then I saw that it was an epic, and the length of the other three books that were out at that time, and I decided not to try it out. But one day I finally gave in after some research to see if the time to read all of the books was worth it and I'm glad I did. If you have never read any of King's books get ready because his imagination is awesome. The way he writes often leaves you longing for more which is exactly the way he wrote this first book in the series. He starts off with the gunslinger chasing the man in black. You have no idea who these people are or why he is chasing him until almost the end of the book. At first the book is a little slow but give it time and it will grow on you. The reason I gave it four stars was that the story gets much better in the second and third books and in this book King is trying to suck you in by giving you little bits of information that drive you crazy because he doesn't give you answers to your questions so you have to read more. I am currently reading the fourth book and some of my questions from this book aren't answered. A pretty good read but still just an introduction to the series. If you get bored with it push through because the second and third books are great reads.
The first and last step on an endless journey I was not a fan of King. Actually, I down right hated his work. I seriously found horror and thrillers boring and predictable. I watched a few movies and often fell asleep. I'm so glad I saw past the psycho killers, demon dogs, possessed evil cars that I thought King was all about. I'm glad that when I over heard Lee talking about the books in High School, I gave King a chance. Actually, Eyes of the Dragon was my first experience with King, and I loved it. Lee told me the Dark Tower was more along those lines and Gunslinger, a shorter novel, would be a quick taste into the deeper world of the fantasic epic. I was not disappointed, not the in least. Gunslinger holds as more like the "Hobbit" was for "Lord of the Rings": it is the prelude to something larger. If your into epics or into King, if you like horror or fantasy or fiction, you'll find something within the pages of this series. The first book is unlike the rest but give the initial impression of the story to come. The story is simple at first, but the layers behind and forward quickly grow to show us a world we are only slightly familiar with, a man we barely understand, and a quest that seems to have a purpose beyond our grasp. And thus "To the dark Tower Childe Roland came."
Prepare for a game of literary hide and seek This book is unnecessarily convoluted. Even after finishing the book, there are so many things that I don’t know as the reader. Things that are absolutely vital to good storytelling. I know hardly anything of the main character, virtually nothing of the antagonist, don’t know what the hell the dark tower actually is, where it is, or why it is important to any one. The conflict between the gunslinger (our hero) and the man in black (the bad guy) is incredibly tenuous at best and absolutely untenable at worst. We think we know who the bad guy is and are pretty sure we know that he did something bad but we aren’t really that sure about it but we’re going to trek all over the place and dedicate our life to finding and killing him anyways. The world building is pretty badly thought out as well in this book. You never really find out what kind of era it takes place in or even what planet it is (yes, seriously). There are pieces out of place and context clues that constantly contradict technology seen elsewhere in the story. You learn some at the very end but even then it’s still very much a shrouded convoluted haze. There are clues here and there but the reader is left to discern most of what’s going on from inference I guess. I don’t really understand why authors do this sometimes. I am all for mystery and twists but this literary game of hide and seek with the reader about just about everything gets tedious very quickly. The Gunslinger is definitely not the worst book I have read. It has promise, the pieces are here for a good story, but there is just so much the reader doesn’t know that it makes it extraordinarily hard to care about anything that happens.
The Beginning of a Masterpiece (*spoilers included*) Just to be clear from the start...The Gunslinger is one of my absolute favorite books, period. By Stephen King or any other author. That said, it's gotten the most mixed reactions of any King book that I recommend to other people. I don't know if it's the contrast between the expectations of what a King book is supposed to be and what he presents in The Gunslinger, but it's not universally loved. I guess fiction that fits mostly into the fantasy genre can have that effect, as it pushes the ability to suspend disbelief to its utmost limits. I've read this book over and over, more often than any other in the series, because of its raw intensity. King's youth and ambition shine through, driving the plot with relentless urgency. I was instantly hooked by the story's opening line, "The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed." I didn't know who the man in black was, or who the gunslinger was, but I wanted to find out. And I wanted to know why the gunslinger was chasing this man, and if he would catch him, and what would happen if he did. I was drawn in immediately, and I've never stopped being fascinated by the Dark Tower series since. People have remarked to me that this book is slow, but I have trouble understanding that. During the course of the novel, Roland shoots and kills an entire town of people single-handedly. He confronts a speaking demon in a deserted way station where he finds a young boy from Earth, a boy who shocks and confuses the gunslinger with his tales of skyscrapers and automobiles. He takes mescaline, giving him the necessary head-trip to bed a demonic succubus and hear her prophecy. He fights off dreadful mutants in a pitch-black mountain tunnel, where he must let Jake fall to his death in order to catch the man in black. In addition to these harrowing scenes, Roland receives a mind-blowing vision once he finally catches his nemesis. The man in black sends him to the very edge of existence, where he passes through a barrier into an alien world linked to his own. He learns that the Dark Tower holds together an infinite number of worlds and universes, and is guarded by an evil being that would see it and all of existence fall into nothingness. After waking from this vision, he embarks on a quest to ascend the Tower and right all the wrongs of his fallen civilization. Like I said before, the Dark Tower story fascinates me, and it all begins here. King draws on his affinity for the spaghetti westerns of Sergio Leone and the fantasy of J.R.R. Tolkien to create the beginning of the most imaginative and ambitious work of his career. Mixed reactions or not, I love this book, and I think it's one of the most thrilling King has ever written.

I was given the best advice by a friend After multiple attempts to read this, I was given the best advice by a friend. The Gunslinger doesn't really pick up until part two, before that the sense of isolation is unnerving. However, once you reach The Waystation is really gets going and doesn't stop. When i finally read it, I skipped ahead, and then went back. This allowed me to really enjoy the town of Tull more thorough as well.
And The Gunslinger Followed Clocking in at under 300 pages, The Gunslinger is a very quick read that is absolutely stunning in its creativity, its depth, and its power to draw the reader deep in to the mysterious life of Roland Deschain. This is the first book of a seven book series entitled The Dark Tower and we find our reluctant hero a gunslinger perusing not only the Tower but the man in black. At first we know of no reason why, but Roland's enigmatic figure draws us to believe that we must support him. We come into his life after a single introductory page that reads "RESUMPTION" a word that would have more meaning if the entire series had been read. However, for the first time reader it is simply resuming his quest through the deserts while chasing down the man in black. It is obvious he had been doing this before and he would do so thereafter. The tale is not so much about the chase, but rather why the gunslinger is doing so. Two tales are told within the story that gives depth and meaning to the gunslinger's life while much stays in the dark for later books. The story itself is mesmerizing. Roland has a unique way of speaking, and King has a unique landscape to paint for us. The world has "moved on" in this unrealistic, realistic world. Things that are similar to our world are represented as being in the past in Roland's. The world is, therefore, not so fantastical as to be unbelievable. Even Roland's temporary boy companion talks of places, things, and people that the reader should be familiar with. This blending of reality with an unrealistic locale and culture simply enchants. The pages breeze by and the story is only party told, only glimpsed at in a glimmering of intricate moments. One can't stop at the first book, but must pursue the tale further. I'll set my watch and warrant by it.
Great read, once again My wife turned me on to the Gunslinger series many years ago and I enjoyed this first book in the series then as much as now. Starting The Drawing of the Three again next and looking forward to the read.
Meh, it was just "ok" - I hope the series gets better! This series has been on my TBR list since I was a teenager! I own multiple copies of the books in the series: Bound copies on my shelves, Kindle copies, and also audiobooks. Yet, I have never read them! I have finally taken the plunge into the series, and it was not at all what I expected! I was hoping for the "creep factor" that I have experienced in other King novels, but it was missing here. In the first installment of The Dark Tower series, we are introduced to Roland Deschain, a Gunslinger whose sole purpose is to meet up with The Man In Black. In his journey along the way, he meets up with a boy named Jake and takes him under his wing. Parts of the book really dragged for me and, even though I finished book, I still feel a bit lost! I will continue on with the series and hope that I get hooked with the next one. This is definitely my least favourite King book, and I much prefer his horror books to this fantasy series so far. However, I am trying to be optimistic that the series will pick up given its popularity. I like the whole good versus evil vibe, and I am hoping that I won't be disappointed! This is my first narration by George Guidall, and his voice was a nice choice for the book. However, his reading does tend to speed up during the more exciting scenes, and I actually had to put my iPod on ½ speed to follow along at a regular pace. MY RATING: 2 stars!! Meh, it was just "ok".
I enjoyed it, but I don't think I will finish the series This book is all about mood, it really makes you feel the dreamlike strangeness of the world. I also enjoyed the main character and his backstory. The problem really is that nothing much happens. Regardless, I think you should read it, because it is enjoyable and pretty short for a Stephen King book. If you like it, the series extends and people tell me it gets even better.
The Dark Tower I: The Gunslinger I have read only one other Stephen King novel, but I am beginning to understand why he is such a popular writer. The Gunslinger was an out standing piece of fantasy writing. It held my attention from start to finish. The setting, the images and particularly the characters were clearly drawn and persuasive. The story was exciting and I am hooked on this series. I strongly recommend this book.
You just have to keep reading! I got the first three books in this series in a gift pack and I have to be honest. I read this book and thought "I have two more of these books to read. Maybe later....." but I did read the next two books and they are terrific. Which is why this review is so difficult. This book introduces the main character of the series, Roland, a gunslinger whose world has "moved on". As I understand it, gunslingers are supposed to be like the knights of old (or at least the old we were taught about in my day and age). They are chivalrous and protect the weak. The problem with this book was that I couldn't really sympathize or feel anything for the character. However, you kind of need this book to get along with the next two (or three or four....).So let me put it to you this way - the next three books are terrific and will be reviewed shortly. This book is iffy, but you really need it to understand what Roland is and why he does what he does - so whether or not you like this book, you'll need it to really enjoy the next set in the series. After reading the second book, I realized the worth of this one. I guess this is a backhanded recommendation - get this book so you can really be entertained by the rest of the series!
great book If you are a Stephen king fan, this book is s must. It actually is a full series. One thing I will not due is give spoilers and ruin the series. All I can tell you is if your Stephen king fan, then this series is a must have
In Stephen King's Epic Genre-Bending Series, You'll Find Echoes of both Tolkien and American History! Review Originally Posted At: www.FictionForesight.com I’d like to start us off with a confession, just to level with you: before this week, I had never read anything by Stephen King. The closest I’d come was watching The Shining during a particularly bleak winter. So, come with me on this journey, erase all knowledge of the master of thrills from your memory, and imagine reading King for the first time. This may be easier for some of you. So, fresh faced and starry-eyed, we open The Gunslinger to read what is arguably one of the best opening sentences ever written: “The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed.” In twelve words, King has given us our protagonist, his quest, the setting, and a whole slew of questions waiting to be answered. Immediately I knew why King is so well renowned for his thrillers – he builds mystery and suspense with just a few words. Each sentence leaves the reader with more questions than they started with. But at the same time, miraculously, he builds three-dimensional characters that are relatable while remaining mysterious. We don’t learn the titular Gunslinger’s name until page 80, but as we follow his gritty, purposeful plod through the desert, this detail seems unimportant. The details of this world are revealed to us in pieces, through the Gunslinger’s interactions with it’s denizens. While not everything is revealed, we can piece together that the Gunslinger lives in a universe similar to ours, but occupies a potential future where the world is desiccated and dying. The human race is struggling, on the brink of extinction. There are remnants of the world we know, such as the song “Hey Jude” and the presence of a long-abandoned subway. But there are only these small pieces to link it to present-day Earth. As the Gunslinger Roland travels across the desert in pursuit of the man in black, he recalls the days when he was young, when he lived someplace verdant and thriving. The Gunslingers were a longstanding profession, but as the world declined so did they – Roland is the last. His adversary, the man in black, is a remnant from this time as well. We don’t learn until the last pages why the Gunslinger is hell-bent on catching this man, but King metes out enough clues to keep us on the edge of our seats, wanting to find out. I’ll mention at this point that reading the Foreword and Introduction by Stephen King added an interesting perspective – the Dark Tower series took more than 20 years to complete. This first novel was published as a whole in 1982, and the last in the series wan’t released until 2003. Upon publishing the last one, King went back and heavily edited and revised the earlier books to better reflect the series as a whole. This book was written by a young, ambitious author, and there’s still a bit of pretension hanging in the corners – but it comes across as concise, collected, and well-planned. I’m eager to see how the writing and the universe evolve over the series. The ending of this first installment leaves much to be desired – there is the conclusion of a character arc but, like the rest of book, the denouement raises more questions than it answers. I have to say it was extremely unsatisfying, but I also have faith that it sets up the rest of the novels spectacularly. I’d imagine that reading just the first book would be akin to assembling the ingredients to bake a cake, and then… just walking away. King has assembled here all the ingredients for a masterful fantasy epic in a vivid, visceral world that hearkens not from European folklore but from Americana. It is an extremely refreshing and enjoyable read and I am eager to follow the eponymous Gunslinger to his demise. Fun fact: Dogs enjoy this book too. Mine found it quite tasty.

Introduction to King's Labyrinthine World and Elaborate Mythology "His shirt, the no-color of rain or dust, was open at the throat, with a rawhide thong dangling loosely in hand-punched eyelets. His hat was gone. " And so the reader is introduced to Stephen King's renowned Gunslinger Roland Deschain, the enigmatic wanderer and chaser of the man in black. I'd read much about King's rabidly adored (or hated) "Dark Tower" series and having just finished his fabulous "It", I was looking to continue the whole dark, deep and moody thing. The first in the series, "Darktower: The Gunslinger" certainly fit the bill...though not exactly what I expected, the book sets the tone for a deeply intricate and cheerless fantasy seemingly set in an apocalyptic old west. Readers must take it on faith that King is leading somewhere good with his epic series, because this first book provides no answers and very little clarity, while building a hugely labyrinthine world and an elaborate mythology. I find King's writing a bit clunkier than usual, and it contains an overwhelming amount of symbolism and vague foreshadowing that I can only assume comes to fruition later in the series...since very little of it did so in "Gunslinger". The read was enjoyable, but any reader should assume a commitment to continuing with the series in order to achiever a fulfilled experience. I was left wanting more, but I'm not sure if I feel that in a good way. ☺
Convoluted language The story jumps around a lot with little in terms of segues. It was tricky at times to even figure out what was going on. I suppose I expected more from the book he allegedly considers to be his magnum opus. I really wanted to enjoy this book, but I had no idea what was going on.
the best stephan king book I have read the whole series many times. This is one of the best books in the series. I don't like the changes in the revised addition. the way I see it the book should read #1 (the original), then 2, 3, 4, the wind through the key hole, 5 , 6, 7, and then this book.
Rocky start to a good series I enjoy the Dark Tower series immensely BUT... The start of the Dark Tower series, The Gunslinger, is rocky, but interesting. The goal of reaching the Dark Tower doesn't come out until the end of the book; reaching the man in black seems to be the goal, the end, not the beginning. Though the book is absolutely necessary and introduces my favorite character, Jake, it just isn't as well written as the following books. That also means the series gets better, so if you like the first book you'll love the second. The dark and gritty overall style of King's writing is evident even at this early juncture, but the flow of the stories is broken due to the fact they were all short stories written to be read one at a time. In part the fantasy adventure story of the Gunslinger reflect a creativity King would use through out his later career (stories were written very early in his career). I have always thought that King was best when writing fantasy novels like The Stand and The Eyes of the Dragon. Part of these and other books he has written appear throughout out the series. I recommend reading this series, though it isn't as enthralling at the start, the series is first rate.
Awesome start to an awesome journey!!!! Unlike a lot of readers of The Dark Tower series, I completely enjoyed The Gunslinger. The pace was a little slower than the later volumes, I'll agree, but I feel it allowed me a more intimate introduction to Roland, the man. This is my second to me through the series and I think I like it even more the second time around...complete with the Horn of Eld.
A Life Changing Series I picked up The Gunslinger at a local B&N about 4 years ago. By that time the first 4 books were out so I didn't have to wait to get into the series. When I finally got to the fourth book (Wizard and Glass), I had to put it aside for a while because I had reached a difficult time in school and needed to concentrate on work. I was also feeling a little bored with the first 400 pages of it. When school ended in June '06 I decided it was time for me to finish up. The books had been eating away at the back of my mine. I was dying to know what would happen to Roland, Jake, Eddie, Susannah, and Oy. By that point the final (and long awaited) ending to the series had been released. I had to resist the temptation to look up spoilers on the internet. I was so glad I did. The ending did not please a lot of readers, but I thought it was the perfect ending. King managed to take what, from any other writer, would only have been a so-so ending and turn it into a life changing experience (at least for me). With my new outlook on life I highly recommend the series: The Gunslinger, The Drawing of the Three, The Wastelands, Wizard and Glass, Wolves of the Calla, Song of Susannah, and The Dark Tower
West Hell The Gunslinger is a great book by Stephen King. I really liked the story behind all the twisting words on the pages. A man who is known as The Gunslinger sets off in hunt for a mysterious man referred to as "the man in black", and finds himself in the presence of a young boy named Jake. Stephen King really gives us a sense of character in The Gunslinger, whether it be from the hard-nosed Gunslinger, the young boy Jake, or the mysterious man in black. When Jake is introduced into the story everything really begins to come together. Before we meet Jake, King keeps the reader guessing at why things are happening in the story. He doesn't take the first few chapters to introduce the characters. He cuts straight to the chase, and begins with the story; we have to get to know the characters as we read the book. I believe that this is what makes Stephen King such a good writer. And if you really like The Gunslinger, there are sequels like Book 2 in The Dark Tower series The Drawing of Three; book 3 The Waste Lands; book 4 Wizard and Glass; and book 5 Wolves of the Calla. The Gunslinger all in all a great book for any mature audience, as well as The Dark Tower series.
Failed to Engage Me I am a Stephen King fan but had never read any of his Dark Tower series, so I decided to give them a try after King revised and reissued them. I'm afraid this series is just not for me. I didn't expect everything to be tied up with a neat bow in the end because this is the first book of a series. But I also didn't expect to be bored, and I was. I really don't much like Roland, the gunslinger. I don't really care if he catches up with the man in black. I don't care if he ever finds the Dark Tower. I did like Jake, a sad kid he met along the way. I am still a Stephen King fan, but assuming that this first book is typical of the rest of the series, this series is just not for me.
Great Start for the Series Right from the start the Gunslinger grabs your interest and doesn't let it go. King gives you a character you know nothing about and has you hooked on him after five pages. In a world very similar to our own, the gunslinger is on a seemingly never ending quest after the Man in Black. In this battle of good and evil, King shows why he is one of the great writers of today. Roland (the Gunslinger) is the last of a lost group of heroes. The story carries you with him across a desert and through a mountain in pursuit of the Man in Black and in search of the Dark Tower. On his Quest, the Gunslinger befriends an overly sexual bartender named Allie and a young boy named Jake. Roland's speed and sureness with decisions has major effects on his relationships with both. King also mixes in brief stories from Roland's past that fill you in on what and who he really is. With a very deep final chapter, King finishes the novel with a strength that no one else could. This ending grandly sets up the next book in the series, where one can only hope that King keeps the greatness of this novel alive in the next instalment of the Dark Tower.
If it do ya, the Dark Tower series is King's true masterpiece. Roland will win you over on his journey to the tower. King has woven a must-read masterpiece. If you have ever read (and enjoyed) a Stephen King book, ANY Stephen King book, take the time to read the Dark Tower. Roland and his Ka-Tet will live in your heart and nightmares forever.
The characters are sometimes hard to love but they grow as the series progress Read this book back in the early 80's. Rediscovered and read the entire series. The characters are sometimes hard to love but they grow as the series progress... Have read many Stephen King books. Have to say this series and The Stand are my favorites.
Good But What's The Plot/Point? This is a really nice and well written novel but I had much trouble understanding what was supposed to happen. I am guessing that this book was to set up for the rest of the series but it didn't exactly set up anything. For 300 pages, this nice character, who occasionally (for unknown reasons) goes postal and slaughters everyone in sight, seeks a man in black. He finally finds him and I don't know if it's just me but I had absolutely no idea what the man in black said to him. The writing isn't too complicated, the ideas are just extremely far-fetched and different; this isn't necessarily a bad thing but to enjoy the read, you have to have an open mind. So, overall, very well written; very confusing at parts, and no true feat to be accomplished. This may seem like a high rating for a not so great review, but this is because 1. I'm not going to trash a book just because I couldn't completely understand it and 2. Every series has to have a first book to explain everything. Definitely read because even if you don't like this, it's worth it so you can continue the rest of the great series. Hope this helps! :)
Better with age I first read The Gunslinger when I was 19, and I liked it then, but I have to say it got better with age. I just reread it (13 years later), and was able to appreciate it so much more this time around.
A Great Series Is Started With A Great Book In a world part fantasy and part old western that is at some points a mirror to our own, a gunslinger named Roland is on the pursuit of the man in black. Roland is the last gunslinger and survivor of humanity in a world that people say has "moved on". Roland travels in the West, chasing the man in black, who you discover is a great sorcerer. The only clues leading to the man in black on the flat, dry hardpan of the desert are the leftover ideograms of his fires. Roland continually feels that he is getting closer to the man in black, but he also feels that the man in black is aware he is being followed and is leaving traps for him. Roland finds his way to a man named Brown who befriends him and allows him to refill his supplies. While talking, Brown learns of Roland's visit in the previous town Tull. He finds out that Roland saw a strange man, who before his visit, had died and had been brought back to life by the man in black. Brown also discovers that Roland met a girl named Anne, and got in a relationship that almost delayed his pursuit of the man in black. Brown is shocked to hear that Roland was led into one of the man in black's traps and was forced to kill an entire town of crazed people, including Anne. After walking across the desert for 16 days, Roland meets and befriends a boy named Jake who is living in an abandoned way station. They both must find the man in black as they continue to the other side of the mountains, where you will discover why Roland is following him. Roland will have to make many decisions regarding his friend Jake in order to continue his journey. I would recommend The Gunslinger to anyone who enjoys fantasy adventure books due to the interesting although complicated plot I found. The book is perfectly structured, and the characters are well built and nearly unforgettable. The words that Steven King uses are so powerful that they can paint a picture in your mind and make you feel like you are a part of the book. I believe that this book is so fascinating that not only will you jump to the rest of the books in The Dark Tower series, but you may also read The Gunslinger once again.
Couldn't get into it. I had heard such wonderful things about the Dark Tower series. With that in mind I purchased this book to give it a try. I just couldn't get into it at all. The book like several others (Neromancer, Snowcrash, Lord of the Rings) had its own vocabulary which was hard for me to get into. I also don't particularly like when authors use spelling to create accents. As a goal oriented person, I had to finish the book on principal haha. I ended up buying the audiobook to try and drudge through it. I felt the entire book was similar to the 300 or so pages in Harry Potter Book 7 where they are in the woods the entire time.. which was horrible. I have actually heard from several who are into the series say "Skip book 1, read the plot summary from wikipedia and start with book 2, it is much better"
... and was very hopeful that I could find another good series to get my teeth into I am a real fan of 'fantasy' type novels and was very hopeful that I could find another good series to get my teeth into. However this one was, quite honestly, extremely hard work to read. It never seemed to gain any momentum and the characters and story were quite superficial. I persevered until the bitter end but didn't enjoy the book at all. Unfortunately I now have to look for another series because I'm not prepared to risk trying the next book after Gunslinger.
I was wondering why I enjoyed the series so much “The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed.” I had read the Dark Tower series years ago and remember liking the series very much. I decided to reread the series when I saw that the movie had started filming. I really don't remember much of the series so I was thrilled to get started. The book starts off with the famous line above. Introduces you very slowly to the characters and through some flashbacks gives more insight. The story is very linear as it follows the Gunslinger as he chases down the man in black. It took longer than anticipated to get into the book as it just seemed odd the pace and the writing. After finishing with the book, I was wondering why I enjoyed the series so much, as this first book of the series is just ok. Best Part of the Book: The chat between the man in black and the gunslinger. The man in black explains the mysteries of the universe, where the greatest mystery isn't life, but size, and goes on to explain all the worlds in a blade of grass (Horton Hears a Who). That nothing is solid and the universe is infinite.
A bit vague The problem with this book is that it seems to start in the middle of a story with no idea whats really happening. We get the idea of the gunslinger chasing the man in black but we don't know why or for how long. The story seems to gain some substance as it progresses; the gunslinger meeting the boy Jake and the events on their journey provide some story line to follow. It is only in the series' suceeding books (the drawing of three, the wastelands) that we get an overall picture of whats happening. The series is like one big jigsaw; instead of a flowing storyline, the story jumps around from the present to the gunslingers past. King is one of the few writers who can do this successfully. Even though I found it hard to follow the first book, the following in the series are excellent and I would definitly recommend them, even though it is necessary to read the first book in order to follow the storyline. A bit of a tough read, but worth it in order to follow the rest of the series.
Great book, worthless Kindle sample I read this book a few years ago. Well, I didn't read it, I listened to it on audio book. Still, this is a great book. It can be a bit slow moving at times but it is a wonderful introduction to one of my favorite literary characters. The real reason I'm writing this is because lately I've have been wanting to re-read(re-listen, whatever) this awesome series because I never finished it. I was looking at it on my kindle and decided to get the sample to whet my appetite, so to speak. Well, the sample is so useless. It is nothing but a three part introduction and then a foreword. That's it. Needless to say, it did not whet my appetite. I still think it is a must read cause the book really is amazing. So for anyone who hasn't read the book and read the less than helpful sample: read the book. Really, it's a very good book with amazing characters, set in fantastical worlds. Dear Kindle, Might want to get your act together when it comes to samples cause if this was a book I had not read this sample might have put me off it. Just saying.
Perhaps King's Finest Tale The Gunslinger, written over the space of twelve years, is perhaps King's finest, most poetic tale. No other character in all of his work is as well-crafted or mesmerising as Roland of Gilead. We not only learn of his heartache, and motivation, and humanity, but we live them through clear, descriptive writing (despite the abundance of adverbs). Many people struggle through the beginning. I urge you to push on. The reward will come. The gun battle in the town of Tull is furious, written with a precision for detail achieved by few writers. Roland's battle with his teacher Cort, for the right to be a Gunslinger, is easily the most triumphant scene of King's I have ever read. By the time you reach the end you will be eager for the next three books, and urging King to write the fifth, sixth, and seventh installements, as he has promised. You will wonder how you have gone without Roland of Gilead for so long, and the Dark Tower will be part of you.
The Dark Tower I heard about this for so long from friends, finally reading it. The book starts slower than I thought it would and there's not as much action as I hoped. The main action is the shootout. It's mostly about a quest for now, so that's why I recommend to those who like books involving quests. I have the second book to start, hoping it's better.
Audio Book 1 of a Series - Get Hooked! If you can not commit to a series DON'T READ THIS BOOK, this is just the beginning of a fascinating story. Reading only one book may result in the negative reviews I've seen, think of each book as a long chapter, and the gunslinger is just Chapter 1. Meet Roland Deschain of Gilead, the last gunslinger, and join him in his quest to find the man in black, he has spent years on this task, and this is just his first step towards his real quest which is finding the dark tower. As I write this review I am starting book 5 of the Audio Books (unabridged); I have never looked forward to my 1 hour commute (each way) until I got hooked on this story, I LOVE traffic jams now. Book 1 and Book 5 are read by George Guidall, books 2-3-4 are read by Frank Muller which I liked much better, and because I started and continued right away with each book, the change really bugged me. But the story is so compelling that I just got hooked again. Join the journey!
Still one of the best out there The Gunslinger is the beginning of Stephen King's great Dark Tower series, but it could have also been a great stand alone book and even though the series grew into something that i didn't particular care for in the later books, this one is still great. If your a King fan and haven't read this series then you owe it to yourself to read it. The first four books are great and while the last 3 are sub-par at least compared to the first four the series is still one of my all time favorites. I would recommend this book to anyone, but with the warning that you may be disappointed with the ending of the overall series, but heck the ride is all that really matters. It's not the destination that's fun its the journey and for the most part this is one of the better journey's out there at least until the end is near. A great book in a decent series by a great writer, so if you haven't read it then pick it up and check it out, I'm betting you won't be disappointed.
Awesome read, better the second time through the series This is actually my 2nd read through the Gunslinger and the first thing that struck me outside of nostalgia of reading it a second time was how well the overall universe was put together. So many things/creatures/themes we encounter in later books are talked about in the first book. I totally missed this on my first read, mainly because I wasn’t familiar with the things yet. > The man in black fled across the desert and the Gunslinger followed. That’s the line that we open with, meeting our man in black and our Gunslinger. We figure out it something like a western, but there are machines around that are clearly not ‘old’, well they are but that’s because we learn that much of the technology to build the things we have today has been lost as the word ‘moves on’. The biggest striking feature of the book is the clarity with which Stephen King describes all the items we see. You end up getting so drawn in to the world it takes you most of the book to realize you haven’t been told the name of the Gunslinger. Much mystery surrounds all the characters we encounter. You probably don’t realize that at first, but as you progress in the series and see many of the people continuing to come back in this world or another gives more weight to the actions taken when you first meet them. Overall, this is one of my favourite series to read.
Fantastic book and series!!! I am three books into this series and I absolutely love it. The story is very new and fresh and keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. The characters are really dynamic and seem to come alive thanks to king's exceptional writing. The elements of fantasy are really enjoyable, but the ties to our world take this story to a whole new level. It has everything from the sky scrapers of NY to demons bears in jungles of other worlds. This book is a real treat to listen to.
It started out good reading and then the longer it went The Dark Tower l: The Gunslinger is typical Stephen King. It started out good reading and then the longer it went, the better it got. This book made you want to finish it because you know Dark Tower ll is waiting for you to dive right in. You just have to find out what happens to the Roland.
Second chances The first time I read this story, I was uninterested. No because it was bad, but I suppose I was tired and reading it during commutes to work. So I wasn't paying much attention and kind of lost the plot. With that, I lost interest. Now I've decided to give it another go, and I'm wide-eyed with intrigue. We follow Roland of Gilead, last of the Gunslingers in a world that resembles a forgotten version of our own. In his quest for a mysterious tower (and the pursuit of the man in black) he encounters monsters and demons and people in need of his aid. With every page we turn, we're learning more about these people, their desires, and what lies at the end of their paths. For those of you who don't know, this is book one of seven (plus an eighth spin-off and a couple of short stories). I read up to the third one on my first bout, and can safely tell you that this is the one that gets the story into motion. But don't be swayed. It's full of action, convincing dialogue and a fully-rounded cast. As I'm new to the fantasy genre, I'm finding myself excited by the adventure and the world that is being built around these characters. In short, I am utterly absorbed.
Strange.. Wow... not sure what to say as I just finished this a couple of minutes ago. I've read the other reviews that say this is the slowest book out of the series and to keep plodding on, which I believe I will do. I'm not sure what I was expecting; I like King and I love TLOTR, but this is not what I expected. I can now appreciate King's forward about reducing ambiguity as there were some passages that were pretty ethereal. I'm still not sure what I just read..
Masterful storytelling...and only the beginning... Master storyteller Stephen King launches one of the greatest epics of modern times, The Dark Tower, in this introductory novel - The Gunslinger. In barely half the length of an average King novel, we are introduced to the main character of the series and given an eerie look into his background and a foreshadowing of his future. The Gunslinger, also known as Roland, is on a quest for The Dark Tower - but more immediately he must track down the Man in Black and try to seek vengeance for all the wrongs he has caused along his path. Along the quest he picks up a companion - a boy named Jake - who claims to be from a different time and place altogether. And this is only the beginning... If you are a fan of great quests and fantasy writing the likes of Tolkien's "Lord of the Rings" (King admits that Tolkien's stories were an inspiration for this tale) then you will thoroughly enjoy the Dark Tower series.
The Gunslinger I'm finding it difficult to decide exactly how I feel about this book. At parts I loved it and at others I was bored by it. I think I will need a reread at some stage to more fully comprehend everything. It was enjoyable though and I look forward to the rest of the series.
The Second Time Around I just finished reading "The Gunslinger" for the second time. I first read it about a year ago intending to read the entire series but life intervened halfway through "The Drawing of the Three" and I just got back to the books. Rather than begin where I left off, I decided to start at the beginning and get back on track. I am so glad that I did! Rather than the difficult reading I encountered the first time, the second reading was a joy. I am staggered by the breath of King's imagination all over again. I would definitely recommend a rereading to anyone who is having trouble following the story! Roland is a complex character, real in the way he wrestles with his conscience as he makes difficult choices. However he never gets so mired in guilt that he is unable to move forward. He finds a way to continue his quest and thus takes his first steps to becoming an epic character.
Wow, What A Read This is only the second King novel I've gotten all the way through. I'm hooked on this series, and I will have to see where it all goes. But this book was like nothing I've ever read. The internal struggle of the main character is particularly riveting. I enjoyed it, and thought it didn't just pretend to be deep but really was 'deep'. More than just a novel, it seems like an exploration of the human soul.
BEST STEPHEN KING BOOK EVER WRITTEN!!!!!!!! AMAZING!!!!!! Best of his work,though I recommend reading the prequel comics first to get more of a background on the main charecter,and belive me you will not beable to put it down.Anyway,BEST STEPHEN KING BOOK EVER WRITTEN!!!!!!!!!!:-):-):-)
#1 of the Dark Tower Saga This is the beginning of a tale, that is still not finished, and may not finish before I die. If it ends before King's dispare, I wonder.... As I started on this one I was litterly pulled into a new world. Never have I been so absorbed bij a book. I 'ate' the complete saga in a month. The book(s) wanted and confinced me to keep reading. I was addicted to the romantic but harsh world of Roland. The combination of present, past and future are magnificant. You will live the life and adventures of each character. This men is the King of story-telling. I read at the cost of my own health, almost like drug. I didn't sleep, but read for a week, when I noticed that THAT was a tad odd. But I read them where and when I could. School, work, home, at my FORMER girlfriends house. People would call me crazy. And it was. I hope I'll never run in to a saga like this one again.
The new version of Gunslinger It has been years since I read the old version. It has been years since I finished THE DARK TOWER series. I think this one is a bit smoother and easier to follow. Now I guess I have to finish the series again. It is a great series. A book to compete with THE STAND, and THE TALISMAN! John. D Elder
A Fine Work of Literature I have read The Gunslinger three times now, and I still enjoy it every time. Every Stephen King fan simply must read this series. I hope it is made into films (or tv series) as Internet buzz suggests it might! But nothing could compare to reading the books for oneself. The series reaffirms why even with a degree in English lit, Stephen King remains my favorite author!
Great intro to an amazing and intense story line Great intro to an amazing and intense story line! The descriptive language all around is thorough, but exceptionally so in the last 15-30 pages. The ending is so vivid and mind boggling you'll remember it like your own memory, may even replicate your version of the settings in a dream to call your's. This is one series I'll have on my bookshelf until I don't have a use for books anymore!
If you've never dipped your toes into the dark river of Stephen King fantasy, this is your chance If you've never dipped your toes into the dark river of Stephen King fantasy, this is your chance. The Gunslinger is the first in The Dark Tower series (8 books total), and it's a story as Un-Stephen King'ish as it gets. A lone shooter, The Gunslinger, traverses his In-world in the search of the man in black and, ultimately, The Dark Tower, through a dreamlike mirror of our existence, complete with references to modern day like Beatles' Hey Jude or Joyce's Ulysses, yet utterly different. I started reading the series at the urging of my boyfriend, and couldn't put the book down (on book 2 now). The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that at some point closer to the end of the book I got upset. All of a sudden the whole quest seemed no more then a boy's play, with men at large being obsessed over a search for manhood. I wanted to yell, please, what about strong women hero characters? But that's just me, don't listen to me. Read it. It's brilliant.
I've begun my journey For the Dark Tower! It's been a while since i have planned on reading the DT series. The reason i held off was because i wanted to read all seven of them in a row, and i had alot of stand alone novels by a few different authors that i wanted to read first(as a matter of fact i still do, but i can't wait anymore!) Also, just last week i recieved Dark Tower six and seven in the mail, and now that i have all of them, it is time i begin! I give The Gunslinger a 4 instead of a 5 because it is a little confusing, and a little on the slow side at times. That being said, since the whole series is really one very long story, i understand the need to have some background and information in the first one to set you up for the rest of the ride. Still, The Gunslinger does have action, and is a great way to start what i just know will be a mind blowing series. This book is very good, and i am planning on the next ones to be GREAT! If you can't tell, i am extremely excited about finally taking the road to the Dark Tower, and i hope to have read them all by the time "Wind/Keyhole" comes out in April....i will review the books as i finish them! Lastly, my "real" rating for the Gunslinger would be like a 4.25....but since a "4" is the closest i can get, i went with that. AHHHH can't wait to read the rest!
Not a Good Start to a Series The Gunslinger by Stephen King is the first book of his popular Dark Tower series. I believe at the moment there is a total of eight books that contribute to the series. To make it clear, I am not a Stephen King fan. I have read some of his books and for most of them, I found myself not liking more of them than the opposite. I've always wanted to give The Dark Tower series a go simply because of the brilliant things I have heard. The Gunslinger is the introduction to the series and gives us readers a chance to get our feet wet. At only 280 pages long, it's perfect for the introductory type books. Not too short but not absurdly long. The problem I have with the book is well, how boring it all is. I definitely expected something more grand, especially due to this being an introduction and as an author, you'll want to capture your audiences attention for the future books to come in the series. The Gunslinger is definitely anything but grand and in a way very disappointing. The Gunslinger introduces us to the character of Roland, the gunslinger himself. Right in the very beginning, you'll find out that he is on a task to chase and find the man in black and ultimately, to find the Dark Tower itself. Exactly why you have no idea. The more interesting part of the book is the alternate fantasy world (mid-world? limbo?) the characters live in. It has this American old west feel to it as many parts of the land is barren. It's hard not to picture of Roland as some kind of cowboy in a classic western movie. But besides that, the world is not exactly the world we live in today. His world has "moved on". Think of it as some sort of post apocalyptic world but not to the heavy extremes. Roland will meet characters that have been part of the before world, something he doesn't quite understand himself. Point is, the world they live in is fairly weird and it adds a mysterious feel to it. Between his travels from different places, the story would give us a flash back of Roland's childhood. The problem is everything just feels a bit odd. I had to constantly remind myself that the original version of this book was written many, many years ago. The author at that time was just starting his career. Much of the book surrounds Roland yet I'm not sure if he's the good guy, the bad guy or someone in between. It feels like a mess at times and the author definitely does help in any way with his writing style. Many users will feel completely frustrated throughout the book because not much is made clear. Again, why is the man in black so interesting to him? There is so much useless drivel going on that it can get quite hard to focus on what exactly is happening in the book. Patient readers like myself who made it to the end are still left with more questions than answers. However, I think that was the point the author wanted to make. Towards the end of the book, the conversation between Roland and the man in black does make some things clear. It portrays the feeling like this is some whole Matrix/Men in Black sort of thing. What the author does do quite well is portraying the world around the characters. He doesn't need to use a lot of words and yet everything is still so vivid in my mind. I guess that shows Stephen King's genius mind at work even when he was still considered an amateur. Action wise, there are some pieces of it here and there but not exactly what I call the main attraction of the story. Roland is a gunslinger and so obviously he has a pair of guns to work with. There was a part in the story where it flashes back to Roland's earlier life battling his teacher that got me more excited than anything he did in the present. Without a doubt, The Gunslinger is a very weird book when you first pick it up. You really need to have an open and vivid imagination to see things through. I have even read that fans of the series did not so much like this introductory book and that things will definitely get better starting with book two. After reading the description of The Drawing of the Three, I can completely agree as well. It definitely sounds much more interesting. The good news for me is that the series has ended as I wrote this review with a total of 7 books in the series. The 8th book is set sometime between the 4th and 5th novel, chronological wise. I will definitely put the next book in the Dark Tower series in my "to-read" list but just when I will get to it I can't say.
Best series ever....I am still waiting on the movie This series is totally addictive and I used to read it every year until I had children...not as much time. Stephen wrote himself into this series and it's fascinating combination of western, sci-fi, and thriller. It's just AMAZING! read it dude.
Persevere - it's worth it. One of the few King novels I've ever had trouble getting into was The Gunslinger. But persevere, because so much depends upon this first book when reading the following volumes of the series. The Oracle's prophecy, the dark man's vision, the sacrificial child who becomes increasingly important as the series grows. Perhaps it was the sparse writing that put me off to begin with - so different from the rich, textured feel of most of King's novels. It's also difficult to empathise with the lone gunslinger. But again, as the series goes on, it's intriguing to watch this obsessed man change and develop further. One needs a starting point, and the cold, single-minded man that Roland is at the outset is a noble one. Still, I was glad when I watched him gradually change and begin to love more than just his Dark Tower
Loved it Reread this after reading The Wind through the keyhole just to re acquaint with my old friends. Can't wait to get into the next book amazing how much I forgot or missed with the first reading. Awesome books thank you Stephen king
a good read - very well written. Many have said that one needs to 'suffer through this book', but reading this is a lot like the Stand. You need to read this for the enjoyment of learning about the characters and the place they are in, rather than expecting a typical good vs bad story. Ready to read the next one.
WOW!!! WOW!!! I came into reading this book with mixed expectations. People either love or hate this one. Even fans who love the entire Dark Tower series, point to this as one of the weakest and hardest to get through. However, I am pleased to say, they were wrong. Maybe it is because I read the version that Stephen King revised to match the tone set forth in the other books. I don't want to give anything away or give a blow by blow synopsis. I do want to say go into this book with an open mind. It is not a typical fantasy book, but is more of an action adventure. The book also raises several interesting questions and I look forward to finding the answers in the coming volumes, I've already picked up Drawing of the Three and can't wait to start finding the answers that both Roland and myself seek.
A strong start, with minor corrections I read and re-read this first book after King decided to update it, thankful that he had chosen to take his time and not tweak the formula or original story too much (cough*GeorgeLucas*cough). The first book of this epic fantasy starts off strong, brief, and without remorse for those who choose to drop it before reaching the ending. It's one of the few books King has written where it truly feels as if the writer himself is free, and King chooses not to attempt to bring out the story too quickly, allowing the gunslinger to travel at his own pace. The story picks up, to be sure, but this book has the FEEL of a western, which means a lot of the tension comes from nothing happening at all. If you can hold off judgment for a few more novels, you'll consider this first book a gratifying read.
What the Heck is Going On? "The Gunslinger" has no easily understandable plot. It is the introduction to the epic that follows. In the beginning, I was hopelessly confused. I had no idea why Roland was looking for the man in black, where he was, where he was from, or what the heck was going on. By the end of the book, I knew a little more, but not enough. Maybe that is why so many are addicted to this series. Beware: this is a bloody, dark, and violent tale with a main character you aren't sure whether to cheer for or despise. Is he a hero.....or what? Now I will have to read at least the next book in the series to see if I can learn any more. But this book in itself was an unsatisfying read. I don't know if I want to sign up for the 7-volume-epic ride. Especially if they are all as bizarre as this one.
The Opening Book to an Epic... I've read a great many Stephen King books over the course of my life, and been a huge fan of his writing. When I discovered this epic, something that was a blend of Stephen King's notorious horror writing and a fantasy world, I jumped on it. To put it lightly, I couldn't put this book down. It was shorter than I'm used to with King's books, but was a fantastic opening to what promised to be an epic series. This particular book deals with Roland and his journey through his broken world after the man in black. We get little glimpses of the conflict between these two, but never a clear idea of what exactly happened between them, or why Roland is chasing the man. All we know is an undying hatred between them. A small town, through a desert, under a mountain, and finally he catches the man. I wont tell you the rest. But I can say, Roland picks up a companion, Jake, a young boy who is taken from his home world and thrown into mid-world without any idea of what's going on. The bond forged between Roland and Jake is one that will break your heart, in the worst way. This is a must-read for anyone looking for a good fantasy read. You won't be disappointed.
The Quick Start to an Epic Adventure Fans be warned: "The Gunslinger" is definitely not typical King fare. But I wouldn't have it any other way. The basic premise of the book is as such: Roland Deschain is the Last Gunslinger (a kind of uber-cowboy, so to speak) in a seemingly post-apocalyptic world, traversing the desert in pursuit of an adversary aptly named the Man in Black. King will amaze you with the deep descriptiveness of this novel. You'll actually SEE the desolate look of desert town dwellers, actually FEEL the sand whip at your face. All in all, "The Gunslinger" is just a beautiful novel, and the start of something much greater. If you enjoy(ed) this book in any way, be sure to pick up the rest of the Dark Tower books ("The Drawing of the Three" is the next book in the series, FYI).
King's Masterpiece I think alot of the other reviewers have already hit on this, but I might as well say it again. Most people will scoff at the idea, (Hell, I scoff at the idea) but this book should be placed among the Masterpieces. The whole concept and ideas behind this book are awesome. Somewhere in all the trials of age, shootouts, and long descriptions of the wastelands, something in this book touched my heart. I've read this book at least 10 times and I love it every time. It's obvious that King put a little of himself in the story, that he's never come close to replicating, even in his attempt with Wizard of the Glass. For the people who say they found the whole story boring...well this book isn't written for you. Try some of King's other more action oriented stories.
A Mystery of the Setting There just isn't a suitable word to describe the masterpiece King has created. When I first picked up this book my mind was convinced this book would be an adventure of a lone wanderer to some mystical place. For the most part this is true but King played, what I would call, a double plot for this book. One of the plots is just that, a lone wanderer searching for a mystical place. The other plot is unique in the sense it is a plot for the reader: to discover the setting and background of the character. I do not want to give away the original setting King has created but I will say I was convinced it was just any old arid desert. As you read you will realize otherwise. King weaves this story with time frames such as those in the past events and the gunslinger's present journey. King has also mastered his ability to take a basic character and build upon an entire emotional and mental structure. He makes you understand the way the character thinks allowing the reader to predict his next words or perhaps no words. This novel had hardly any bland pages. Every event led to another and ever other was seemingly original. The end of this book can be a little much for the human mind but I do not want to discuss anymore to prevent giving away any surprises this book has in containment. This novel is a five star novel and one I absolutely recommend reading. This novel begins a journey that unravels into what I believe to be extraordinary series of novels: The Dark Tower.
Why it works...... I read this sometime after it came out, back in the day when word of mouth was probably the best way to find a good read. This qualified immediately. There's a reason that this book worked for me. I think every American my age (40's) was exposed to the cowboy myth while growing up. This book expanded the myth into a legend. It was the first (and to date only) "western fantasy/supernatural" novel, though it was predated by "High Planes Drifter" which has the same tone. Roland struck me as a fully developed character. The author knew who he was, but exposed him almost miserly. This kept the interest and tension high through out the book. I would highly recommend this for anyone who is looking to blend the cowboy myth and fantasy.
IT'S THE END OF THE BEGINNING For many years now I have been told to read The Dark Tower Series. I have put it off and put it off. I love Stephen King and his endless talent for writing but I admit that once in a blue moon, he produces a dud...after all; even gods have off-days! So, I feared that his Dark Tower books may have been under that category. On my 36th birthday, my better half presented me with the entire Dark Tower series. I was speechless and I plan to read and review each and every one of them. It won't be hard considering that I just finished "Gunslinger" in less than two hours. It sucked me right in. I would write more but my hands are shaking in anticipation for book two. Just trust me, read it for yourself and please do not wait as long as I did to start the series.
A journey begins I don't know why I didn't read this book sooner. It is incredibly well written and it absorbs you. If you enjoyed reading Lord of the Rings, you will probably enjoy The Gunslinger as well, and cherish it.
Whetting your appetite The Gunslinger introduces us to Roland, the last gunslinger. Gunslinger is pretty much what it sounds like, only way more badass. The first book whets your appetite for Roland's world--one of many worlds--and touches on the surface of his quest for the tower, the evil of the Man in Black, and Roland's troubling past that has left him without his family and friends. I still am not sure if I like Roland, but I respect him. His discipline and focus is admirable and though I haven't quite figured out what his values are, I believe he has them and sticks to them. Using the word "harsh" to describe Roland is a huge understatement. He goes where he needs to, for as long as he needs to, and does what he needs to, even if that includes losing the loved ones he has left to get closer to the Tower. Why does he need to go to the Tower? I have no idea. But I'll stick around to find out. Some quotes I liked: --The only contingency he had not learned how to bear was the possibility of his own madness. --It was an old yellow sound, like turning pages. --...but it's very rotten. Like the ideas of certain people, maybe. Just about every time I picked up this book I couldn't put them down. Stephen King's language is as beautiful and intriguing as the characters he's introducing you to. He comes up with people and scenarios and sentences I couldn't imagine in my entire life.
This series is one of my favorite of anything I've read This series is one of my favorite of anything I've read. And I'm really not a Stephen King fan on the whole. This is just so well written and probably the closest thing to perfect literature he will ever pen.
This book rocks If you thought Stephen King was only about horror then you my fellow readers were wrong. Stephen King has created a whole new world of adventure, love, terror and impossibilities from his own imagination. In the beginning Roland, the last Gunslinger, is chasing a man named Walter across a desert. During his chase he meets a boy named Jake from New York. Jake was sent to this world by dying in his own. Over a period of time Roland grows fond of Jake. And Jake like wise grows fond of Roland. But Roland is so obsessed with the Dark Tower that he would rather Jake die than loose the trail of the man named Walter. In the end Roland finally catches up with Walter and learns about his future from him. A future that looks rather promising.
the beginning of a saga Somewhere around 30 years ago Stephen King began a saga (one which many of us wondered if he'd ever finish) of epic proportions: The Dark Tower. Personally, I think it is his best work. The Gunslinger introduces us to Roland, Jake, the man in black, and the Dark Tower. It's a series of interrelated long short stories. And you can tell it is an older piece of King's, it reads like an older work of King's (even though he has somewhat revised it slightly in this latest edition). But still, even though it hasn't the narrative speed the other volumes has, it has its charm, and it is vital in introducing us to the character of Roland and Roland's quest. If you haven't started this series yet, why wait? He's finished the story. Get to it.
The first book was not the best SK has written but I could not put book ... Keep reading. The first book was not the best SK has written but I could not put book 3 down. This book lays down the background for the following books which seems a bit slow at some points but is absolutely necessary to understand these characters and the world they live in.
The Gunslinger As many other people have said, including Stephen King himself, this book is quite a bit different from his normal horror-style books. The writing in the book is done well, and leaves a certain amount of mystery that leaves you wanting to read on about Roland of Gilead, the gunslinger himself. Unfortunately, the vague past given about Roland can leave people confused or just make them loose interest. The first book is slightly different from the later books, but it is interesting in its own ways. The little links to our world definately add to the story, making you really think about the world you're reading about. This book is definately worth reading, but be prepared to have the urge to read the rest of the sprawling series.
The beginning of an incredible saga This book, and the series(so far at least) is pretty different from much of SK's other works. Ive recomended it to many friends and relatives, and most of the time get that question "Whats it about". Thats a really tough one with this book, and series, basically its about Roland and his quest for the Dark Tower, but explaining much more than that in an understandable way is hard. Someone compared it to Lord of the Rings, and I dont think thats an unfair comparison, they're both fantastic tales of fantastic journeys, and they're both absolutely incredible to read. Read it, you'll be doing yourself an incredible favour, trust me(or if you dont, trust all the other people who also love it).
Size defeats us all. Reread the updated volume now that the series is complete. Sub-chapter 'V' of chapter 5 sums up the this priceless piece of work, setting the stage for the remainder of the journey. Size indeed defeats us all.
The Beginning I've read this series multiple times, and every so often it will lure me back. Every time I read it I notice something new, foreshadowing is a little easier to spot, little nuances in a phrase spark a greater understanding. It is said "A journey of one thousand miles begins with a single step." This journey begins with "The man in black fled west, and the gunslinger followed." It is the start of a journey that will lead to places both familiar and strange. I feel that it is a journey that everyone should take, at least once.
the greatest series ever writen obviously this book was writen so many years agoand doesn't compare to his brillant writing now, but this book properly kicks of the dark tower series. anyone who loves his work will find when they finish book one, you have to finish the series. starting with the gunslinger and moving through to number four (wizard and glass)you'll find it so addicting that books 5-7 can't come out on print fast enough. i loved the adventure this series took me on and found myself upset that it ended. you'll want it to keep going. out of all is books (which i've read and own) these were the best and hardest to put down. i recomend this book to all of those fans that love to get lost in a stephen king book.
First read through. This was my first read through of The Gunslinger, and actually my first Stephen King novel. Many would advise against starting here with an author of such renowned, however I feel these books are what he truly wanted to be remembered for and it shows in the writing. Each word left me wanting for the next, packed with a full spectrum of emotions, and I cannot wait to read the next book in the series. My only concern is that the TV series/Movies will not do these books justice.
I know what made this book so cool Besides the obvious coolness of the story line what made this such a kick butt book was the fact that Roland(AKA-The Gunslinger) was not given a name untill the last chapter. This book is so great yet at the same time it is very underrated I know King fans that have never heard of the book much less the Dark Tower Serise. Bottom Line-If you have never hearsd of these books or do not have any idea what I am talking about now would be a great time to start. Weather it is the plot (Good vs. Evil) or the charecter development both of which are better than The Stand. Even if want something that will suck you in and not overtax your mind I recommend it.
Worth Reading to get to the Others This was one of Stephen King's earliest attempts at writing a novel, and it kind of shows. It's slow at times. A little grey. There are some great action scenes, but mostly you end up not caring much about the main character and not understanding the world that he lives in. However, the very next entry "Drawing of the Three" is one of the best in the series, and The Gunslinger is required reading to understand it. It's worth getting through the 220 or so pages to get to the other books in the series. And the Gunslinger isn't completely unenjoyable. It just doesn't live up to the rest of the series or the greater story of the Roland's quest for the mysterious Dark Tower.
SIMPLY AMAZING FANTASY!!! Whilst the opening sentence to this book may well go down in history as one of the most famous in the modern era of popular fiction, for me, having read this series five times and about to embark on yet another sojourn to locate the magical and mythical Dark Tower, it is the opening to the second paragraph of the book which makes it quintessentially Gileadean, and of course uniquely Kingensian: 'The desert was the apotheosis of all deserts, huge, standing to the sky for what looked like eternity in all directions. It was white and blinding and waterless and without feature save for the faint, cloudy haze of the mountains which sketched themselves on the horizon and the devil-grass which brought sweet dreams, nightmares, death.' Mr King takes a breath, and then progresses to talk about the character central to the entire voluminous seven-book series: The Gunslinger. In a few short heartbeats, the reader learns that whilst he is thirsty, he yearns not for a drink. Whilst he is true, he is not a holy man, not a follower of the Man Jesus. We meet a farmer called Brown, who lives with a talking Raven. We learn shortly of the town called Tull, and of course we learn of the Man In Black. He may be many things, Roland tells Allie, "... But a liar isn't one of them." This book is a classic. Newcomers may well wonder what the fuss is all about but those strange members of the human race known as "Constant Readers" will savour every word, every drop of atmosphere which drips from the book as you turn each page. Some revelations are shocking, and disgusting, until you remember who wrote the story in the first place. Most however, are fascinating, and are like going back through history and asking yourself the same questions over and over and over again: "where were you when this happened? Do you remember this?" Of course in some cases, even for constant readers, the answers may sometimes (shockingly) be no - it is hard to remember every word in every book when you read 2 or 3 books per week, every week, for years on end. But I digress. Some questions that are central to the story line will by necessity have to remain unanswered in this review. The core points to remember are this: the book is easy to read, hugely entertaining, with a gripping plot, amazingly strong characters all set in a brand new universe which is like nothing you have ever read. Yes, it parallels the one we find ourselves in daily, but that just makes the story all the more compelling. As the author so helpfully points out in his insightful introduction, it is indeed a cross between Lord Of the Rings and "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly". Indeed, your enjoyment of the book, and the series as a whole, will be enhanced if you remember this single, solitary fact. But by all means jump right in, read it. Let it change your life. But just remember, the devil is in the details. And he makes his first appearance on page twenty nine of this extraordinary opening to an incredible reading experience, which incidentally, equals nineteen plus ten. BFN Greggorio!
A Post apocalyptic lovers Dream Book. King's Story of a world that has "Moved On" is extremely entertaining. A Post apocalyptic lovers Dream Book! Set in the far off future ware were not shooting at each other with Laser beams but Hard Caliber 6 shooters. Roland is a Gun Slinger, a Law Giver on a quest to find the Dark Tower, a nexus point that holds millions of time lines and worlds in check. Rolands quest will sling shot him back and forth between the present, future, and Past. All of Kings Books tie into this Dark Tower in some way or another. When you finish the Story, your going to want to re-read the Dark Tower series Again, & Again to catch the subtle nuances that tie everything together.
Big surprise for me. If you are like I was, not getting into this series because you just couldn't imagine Stephen King writing anything that had to with a western type fantasy, then get into this series now! I made the mistake of putting it off. Read the first book in one sitting and I'm on to the next six. This is a simple read in the sense that it's a small book in page numbers. King packs the story into every sentence and has you turning pages faster than you can imagine. This book is not on par with masterpieces like, Pet Sematary, or The Stand, but it's not the let down that From A Buick 8 was either. Get this now and enter a world you will not want to leave any time soon.
There's nothing like a walk in the desert This book is literally about someone walking across the desert - and is strangely captivating. Granted, this is no ordinary individual as the "constant reader" is introduced to a character that many have come to adore - Roland, the gunslinger. This series is difficult to describe - part western, part science fiction, alternative universe, fantasy, epic - where none of these categories does justice to the magnitude of the Dark Tower series. This book should also have a warning sticker "Do not start, unless you are ready to become engrossed by the full series" - it's tough to stop once you've started your own journey to the Dark Tower.
Some words about the whole series, no spoilers. Ah The Dark Tower Series. A journey wrought with frustrations and rewards, a few chuckles and a few tears, and a few "are ya kidding me??? was he on crack when he wrote this??" and "are you kidding me?? was he touched by some god of literary hot-doggery when he wrote this???" A journey of any length and depth should be filled with all of the above. According to my "manage your kindle" page here on Amazon, I bought The Gunslinger to begin my adventure into this 7 book series on March 16, 2014. Why? Because of one simple sentence, a sentence I read perhaps even within these reviews for this book although now I can't say for sure. The sentence read: "If you want to understand the world of Stephen King, read The Dark Tower series first, then read the rest of his books." Too late for that. I've already been through about 5 other SK stories. But no matter. I only yearned more to know: what in the Sam Hill 'tire nation was that turtle all about in the book It??? So I took the dive, or followed across the desert as it were. And on this day of Saturday, October 11, 2014, I woke at 3:00 in the morning from a dream about a hammer head shark that caused the end of a softball game that I was about to play in the ocean and caused me to run frantically looking for my two children who were swimming naked deep at the bottom of a pool (Oh Freud, where art thou?).. I finished book 7. And now a few words: If you decide to take this series on you may read many reviews of each of the books. You'll see some favorable, some not. You may get a sense that one book is loved more than others, such and such book was the best in the series, so and so book was not the strongest, etc. The sense I got was that Books 1-4 were true to the tale, books 5-6 were fillers, and book 7 of course was the monumental ending. Many seem to agree that book 4 was their favorite. I can see why, it was an epic tale. But I have a different take. By the end of book 4 I was ready to throw in the towel. I read a few other books, then returned to the series. I'm a completist. Here's my personal take on each book. Book 1: Getting to know this insane world. Lot's of questions. Is it thousands of years in the future? A parallel world? Book 2: Introduced to some characters that I didn't really like or connect with. So odd that these characters would end up in a series like this. They don't fit. The story was told well, but the characters bugged me. Book 3: This was the low point of the series for me. I was becoming very skeptical at this point, questioning whether I should continue or not. My interest started drifting. The characters were here to stay and they were put in situations that I found rather silly. The series started feeling like a failed attempt at this point. But book 4 seemed to be a favorite so I pressed on. Book 4: I could see why many favored this book although I didn't. It's a story shared by the main character to his friends (ka-tet) of something that happened when he was about 15 years old. In and of itself, it's a well told story. I wasn't dazzled. I enjoyed this book way more than book 3 but I still wasn't dazzled. C'mon, I read It and The Stand. How does King consider this his magnum opus?? Like Forrest Gump I thought, well, I made it this far, so I kept runnin'. Now I feel truly discouraged. If many people consider books 1-4 true to the series and books 5-6 filler, then I really must be in for a dull ride. But all of the favorable reviews for the final book kept me going. Plus I start to feel the need to find out how this tale ends. So I enjoyed books 1-4 somewhat, didn't hate them, need to get to book 7, reading books 5-6 is the only way to do that. Book 5: I don't care what anyone says. It was at book 5 that I started to feel that King talent that I love. That King touch that keeps readers coming back. This is pure King. I felt that King's storytelling for this series at this point was kicked up several notches and would only continue to be kicked up. Could it be something to do with the 6 year hiatus from the series? the accident? Couldn't say but now I'm sold. I'm invested. Book 6: The momentum continues. Now I feel that King is leading us on the journey to the Dark Tower itself. It's close. Just need to do some very important things before we get there. I'm hooked. I can't wait. What book did I hate? Think was childish? I don't remember. Book 7: I don't think I've ever been more excited to sink my teeth into a book. King, you did it again. You've got that keep-ya-comin'-back-for-more ability. How long is this book??? I don't care! But wait, can King give me the ending that will put a bow on this series? Will it be all that I hope for? Well I promised "no spoilers" and I'll keep that promise. But I will say as I came to the end, at 5:30ish in the morning, King did give me an amazing ending, a sublime ending, a poetic ending, heartfelt. But wait, then we get a scolding, then even more of an ending that will leave you slack jawed. I read the last part again, turned off my Kindle in the darkness of the morning (thank you built in light), and tried to digest the series as a whole. Not book 2 or book 5 but the whole thing. I returned to book 1 to reread the first few pages, shook my head in awe, then got out of bed for the day with a sense of satisfaction and fulfillment. It's true, if you want to understand the world of Stephen King, read the Dark Tower series. Please hold on, keep going, don't give up. It's a journey. One like the characters themselves took. It has highs and lows. But in the end you'll say thank ya. A bonus: at the end of book 7 there is a list of SK books (there to fore) and all of the ones that have a tie in to the dark tower are in bold letters (The Stand, It, Hearts in Atlantis, etc.). Early in the series I thought that this series was for die hard King fans only. Others need not apply. And I would have probably told others if they asked to skip it, read other King books. But now I can only say you will be so much more enriched, in the know, fulfilled in a literary sense if you read this series. If it do ya, in the end, you'll say thank ya big big.
Weird, Wild Stuff Fantasy’s wizardry never managed to enchant me, and I never much cottoned to Westerns, but Stephen King’s THE GUNSLINGER manages to fuse these two disparate genres and deliver an experience unlike any other. I use the word ‘experience’ because it’s accurate: THE GUNSLINGER is richly engrossing as it transports you to a world carved out of pure originality. Our titular hero, Roland, is questing his way through a desert wasteland. His quarry is The Man in Black. Think you’ve seen this story before? Nope, not by a long shot, pilgrim. The parched world Roland wanders through is unlike any other in fiction. It certainly defies concise description, but here’s an attempt: it’s a cowboy tinged universe with saloons and brothels, but it’s littered with contemporary icons which offers (possibly) some kind of post-apocalyptic vibe, while a supernatural element introduces sorcery and also a likelihood that the entire sphere may be an afterlife of sorts, but there’s also a medieval kind of walled-off kingdom that factors into flashbacks. Oh, and a guy gets his face eaten by a hawk. Yeah… Beyond the structural, Stephen King harnesses a new writing style that is Old Testament meets Cormac McCarthy (only less head-scratch-inducing). Despite being more obscure than the typical King prose, it’s a fitting technique that underscores THE GUNSLINGER’s central strength: it is immersive and unique. A star is subtracted due to the ending being unsatisfying, but not unsatisfying enough to discourage me from continuing on Roland’s journey in the sequels. THE GUNSLINGER demonstrates why Stephen King is a great author, regardless of the insults hurled down from dusty perches populated with cranky, overfed literary professors.
I really enjoyed this book I really enjoyed this book. My daughter had given me her copy to read, she thought I would like it. I really enjoy Shephen King, and have read a lot of his books. I am looking forward to reading the next book in the series.
The first book is allegedly the worst of the bunch I'm going to hack my way through all seven books before the movie comes out. The first book is allegedly the worst of the bunch, so that's going to keep me going. At the end of book 1 we don't know very much about anything. But I guess that's what also keeps us going. Some of the flashbacks were a bit weird.and the made-up words caught me off guard at first. But then Shakespeare made up words too. There are plenty of online resources to tell you the definitions of the words. On to book two... I'll set my watch and warrant on it. Long days and pleasant nights to you all.
The quest begins... This is my second reading of this book. I hardly ever reread a book, but this book will keep me (re)reading for hours! There are so many adventures afoot, as I am introduced to the gunslinger and Jake. The rest of the books bring in a cast of characters that do not disappoint. Great beginning.
Revisiting the series I read all the books but the last a few years ago. Since I decided to finally finish the series, I decided to start at the beginning. The second time through causes things to make a little more sense.
and I liked the story well enough to listen to the whole ... I'm ambivalent about this book. The prose and worldbuilding are very appealing, but it's also dated - the pacing is rambling and the ending is a self-indulgent metaphysical ramble, and the only thing the female creatures (I can scarcely call them characters) want is sex. The audiobook is well-acted, and I liked the story well enough to listen to the whole thing despite having read the comics. I preferred the structure of the novel, which reveals backstory gradually. Unfortunately the voice actor for book 2 is different, so I won't be continuing the Dark Tower series, at least for a long while.
Review of Gunslinger This is the first of Steven King's Dark Tower series. It is well written and has a lot of action in it. It is Steven King. I reminds me of a bizzaro western. It has nothing too scary. I liked it. There are some adult situations, but nothing graphic. Some of it reminds me of a good western action book. Some parts are a little weird, but remember who wrote it. In general, I would recommend it.
Restored faith in myself I am not the most avid reader. I like chapters and conclusions and plot lines that each have a purpose...or so I thought. The Dark Tower series has restored my faith that I can actually sit and enjoy reading a book simply for the joy of reading it. Not every character has to be essential, not every moment has to be epic. Some chapters are just a few words long. But I didn't ever notice. This is the first book I can remember just reading, not worrying how long it is or how much I have read. It can go on and on and I will continue to enjoy it. 7 volumes? Bring it on...
Superb Definitely one of King's better works. Very imaginative, and the protagonist is one of the finest knights I have encountered in any work. This is not a work of horror, but is instead an introduction to an entirely new universe, one that ends up tying together many disparate works by King, including "It", "The Stand", "Salem's Lot", and others. Reading this will not move you to take on a new philosophy, but you will be transported to a place that is enchanting, whole, and intriguing. This book showed to me that King can be quite a bit broader in his writing than I had previously assumed.
While I enjoyed it, I didn't love it or even like ... I first read the Dark Tower 1, about 12 years ago. While I enjoyed it, I didn't love it or even like it a lot. Since then I've re-read it several times and very much enjoyed it - almost loved it. My lack of loving it is not a reflection of the quality of the book or of King's writing (as he's my favorite author) but the fact that I have favorites (books 2,3, and 5) in this series which were so influential and moved me so much that I can say I loved them. The ambiguity in the ending of Dark Tower 1, I especially liked. I've heard that not many people enjoy this type of ending. Most readers want all loose ends tied up neatly. * SPOILER ALERT * This book ties up one loose end, that is the Gunslinger finally catches up to the Man in Black. However, multiple other loose ends are added very near the ending. I loved this aspect of the story and it's what drove me to read the next book in the series. I initially picked up this book because it appeared to be a Western, and I have a soft spot for this genre. After reading though, I found this book (and series) to be a wonderful mashup of Western, Fantasy, Scifi, and Horror (naturally since it's Stephen King). This blending of genres doesn't sound like it would (or should) work but I found it to be a refreshing and splendid style of storytelling. Above all, this story is a Western and unlike any Western I've ever witnessed. If you enjoy the classic trappings of the Western genre (deserts and gunfights) along with some unexpected elements of magic - then you will thoroughly enjoy this book.
" Brilliant character development In his first chapter of the 'Dark Tower,' Stephen King introduces Roland, The Gunslinger, who begins his search for The Dark Tower in the bleak and barren landscape after the world he once knew has "moved on." Brilliant character development, surreal encounters, frightening and ominous signs of what's to come--the best of Stephen King. You'll want to have the next chapter, 'The Drawing of the Three' ready to dive into because you won't want to waste a minute.
fantastic product quality and excellent book. The book was in excellent condition. I began reading it thinking it was a parallel to the wizard of oz series (which after one book I was unable to find) but I am very happy with it! I was afraid being a Stephen king book that it would be too graphic or scary, but it's perfect! A little dark, but in a beautiful way. I really enjoy it. If you buy it, go ahead and buy the second book at the same time so you don't have to wait.
Starting an Incredible Epic. All I can say is wow. If you start this book, you will be drawn to the next. Then the next, and so on and so forth. I have just finished the Dark Tower series; if you start this and finish it you will not regret it in any form. While I found the series as a whole incredible and simply amazing, one of the installments (albeit necessary) drug on a bit to much. I hope if you like this book you find the will to read through to the dark tower. It is a modern day epic, and in my opinion, only the lord of the rings and few other sagas can stand with this. Roland Deschain will become you, the tower will draw you as close as it does Roland. Do not believe me? I dare you to read then!
A fantastic read I read this book because it was a friends favorite book and the colorful character of the gunslinger was a poetic metaphor for him. I never understood things he did but I can see this character was almost a mirror image of him. The book was amazing read and I was on edge the whole time following the gunslinger. Will read this one twice. ☺️
Great Journey with the King, Steven King. From the first line when "The Man" is in the desert following Merlin, this 7 series of books was a great read and a wonderful adventure until the last when King really blew me away, closing the story with the opening line of this book. You'll have to read it for your self if you want to know the line. Surreal to say the least, and not a horror story which most people equate King with. There is no better spinner of tales than Steven King the master, and I hope he comes up with another like this before the next 20 or so years it took to finish this one.
a good start If you read Stephen King's introduction he explains that this is one of the first books he ever wrote and he notes that the language is dense and hard to read. I agree. But he really lays a foundation here for an unlimited universe of novels. I look forward to reading the other Dark Tower stories.
First Stephen King book and it was a surprise I picked up this book because I saw the news of its filming and figured I get a taste of it before the movie release. I had no idea of Stephen's writing, but man it took me some time to learn some of the language. Overall, I enjoyed this book and planning to read the rest of the series.
fantastic A wonderful blend of science fiction, post apocalypse with a strong dash of the supernatural, wrapped up in a western package. It's easy to see the influence that this work has had on so much that has come after it. Although confusing at times, I very much enjoyed the story and the characters. Looking forward to the next installment of the series.
Roland ROCKS! The Gunslinger begins the tale of Roland Deschain, of the House Of Eld, on a Knight's Quest to save the Dark Tower. Along the way, he finds, loses, finds again an amazing company of friends/family that makes this the second best effort of Sai King!
Dark Tower, Book 1. Read. First book of the Dark Tower series. So of course you're going to read it. And if you read it, you'll read the next one. And the next, and so on. So what do you want to know? Is this book good? Yes. Good enough to hook someone (namely me) into the entire series. Is this the best book of the series? No. Neither is it REALLY the beginning. Not really. So read it. It's a short read. If you like fantasy, I can almost guarantee you'll like it. But, a word to the wise.. King is, at times, extremely... raw. Yes, that's the word. He's raw. He writes about everything... Death, blood, suffering, sex, (not in this book) incest.. So, if you are brave and adventurous enough, take a step into Mid-World with Roland and start your journey to the Dark Tower.
Not for me This book is obviously well written, but I could not get into it. It did not create a interesting world for me like Tolkien does. Other reviews had prepared me for the slow pace of this first book and I did finish it, but in the end the gunslinger was not a character I found endearing like Frodo or magical like Gandalf. It is quite possible that I am getting too old for fantasy, who knows. I did buy book 2 of the series but put it aside after 20 pages. Not for me.
This is the book that made me a reader for life My dad brought me to the book store when I was 13 years old. I, with great luck, picked this book out. It made me into a reader for life. The world sucked me in. The vague, but intriguing story held me from cover to cover. So if you're young, or you want an open ended adventure to suck you in for many thousands of pages (meaning this and the rest of the series) then dive in and read these books. They are something to behold, and they just may make you enjoy the art of writing all that much more.
The BEST of King I continue to reread the dark tower because it opens a part of my imagination that longs for the battle of good versus evil. The dark tower affirms that their is Sacrifice on the course of life that sometimes is sweet an yet other times is a bittersweet nectar that leaves a taste in your mouth that doesn't ever seem to go away.....
The Start of a Long Journey I read this book in my twenties, I think. I've read it again, now, in my mid fifties. MIT was unusual and confusing then, and it still is now. Not a bad thing, but I must suspend all expectation while reading this series. An unusual experience for me. I called this book surrealist prose years ago, and I still find this to be true now. However, this book thrilled me with Stephen Kings joyous use of language and his desire to explain certain abstract experiences of being human that blow me away. The guy is a genius and his writings monumental as the dark tower itself. Getting a glimpse into Kings mind is a journey requiring some courage but worth the risk. This first book of a series spanning over two decades is as good as anything he's ever written but more different than anything he's done before or since...see? My writing is cryptic and disjointed - lacking linear description useful to anyone bothered to read this review....DONT BOTHER READING MY DRIVEL!!!!! READ THE BOOK, YOULL LOVE IT!! Four stars only because I'm too dim to get all the subtleties!
Great book but not the best in the series. In The Gunslinger (originally published in 1982), King introduces his most enigmatic hero, Roland Deschain of Gilead, the Last Gunslinger. He is a haunting, solitary figure at first, on a mysterious quest through a desolate world that eerily mirrors our own. Pursuing the man in black, an evil being who can bring the dead back to life, Roland is a good man who seems to leave nothing but death in his wake. So along with the BookLikes crew (as I now refer to them) I have started a re-read of The Dark Tower series from Mr King with the first volume – The Gunslinger. We’ll get the bad out of the way first – this is not my favourite of the novels in this series. In fact I will be honest and say the first time I read it I ALMOST did not continue, despite my absolute regard and love for the writing of Stephen King…I thought that perhaps his epic fantasy would not be for me. I was utterly wrong of course, so very wrong and I now stand here corrected. The second reading of this gave me much more – possibly because I know what is coming, I absolutely think this is a must read – however I would still tell anyone coming at this for the first time, this was written when the author was young and whilst it has been updated and expanded, it remains in this readers opinion the weakest of the Dark Tower Series. That is not to say that it is bad, it is in fact extremely good. Still, you may be tempted, like me, to abandon the rest – don’t do it. Keep going. If only because you will then one day experience the sheer brilliance of Wizard and Glass. In this volume we meet Roland as he crosses the desert in pursuit of the man in black – as we follow him on his journey we get hints of his past and possibly his future – and soon his quest for The Dark Tower will truly begin. As usual its Mr King’s imagery that will get you – every single time. The bleak landscapes, the terrifying encounters and as always a strong and beating heart at the centre of the tale, this sets the scene for a truly magnificent quest that will take over your life until you are done. All in all a decent read, see the caveats above and dive in. Ultimately this is a journey worth taking. Happy Reading Folks! **Copy from owned Stephen King Collection***
I R confused This is the first book I've read that was written by Stephen King. It definitely wasn't what I was expecting. He is a terrific writer! I rarely found myself trying to speed up my pace to get through sections, which I do quite a bit in books when I get bored. He kept me entertained almost the entire time. The crazy thing about it, is that I have almost no clue what is going on after finishing book 1 of "The Dark Tower" series. I'm pleasantly surprised that I am as eager to keep reading the series that I know nothing about as I am. Some part of me feels like I should be mad about being kept in the dark and being confused. WTF King, wtf? Well played sir, Let see what happens next..
Just blew my mind. I'm all in. The gunslinger is in me. This was a quick read and I can't wait to start the next. This is not at all what I expected which makes it ten times more satisfying. If you like to question the universe and all of its wonder and like cowboys of the Jose Wales elk than you've come to the right place.
An enigmatic introduction to Roland's world. Maybe start with the 2nd book? Stephen King, ever the fossil hunter of stories, didn't know much about this Roland Deschain character or the quest he was on when he wrote what would become the series' most famous line, “The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed.” As the reader, we get to explore this strange, eerily familiar dystopia much in the same way King discovered it. The downside is that Mid-World, the world the Constant Reader has come to know and love throughout the series, isn't as well defined in this first volume. And I agree with those who say that the quest for the Dark Tower doesn't find its voice until the next book, The Drawing of the Three. Even though there's much to appreciate here—the writing, the illusive Man in Black, the ghostly haunt of Roland's childhood—the story can't help but feel cold and distant. In a sense, the Gunslinger is like the deviant cousin of the Dark Tower family, one who is easily misunderstood and often shunned. More than once I've recommended that new readers to the series start with book 2. To King's credit and for the betterment of the story, he revised The Gunslinger back in the early 2000's with the intent of bringing it closer in tone to the later novels. This revision grounds the narration in the familiar Mid-World jargon and is now the version I prefer.
A different view I am continually amazed every time I read another book by Stephen King! The diversity of his writing that takes place at different times during his life, and the beginning of this series reflects it. I can hardly wait to see how this series progresses with different ideas and ideologies.
Enchanting book and the first door into an incredible series Cannot recommend this novel highly enough. It is a wonderful and quick read that sends you down the path of this series with eagerness and awe. Highly recommended for Sci-Fi, action/adventure, and mystery fans.
A misleading start This book is really not meant to stand alone. If you read just this book, you will probably not like it very much. It's rather slow moving and has a very unsatisfying conclusion. However, pair it with the second book in the series and you will probably think that Stephen King is a genius. So I give it 5 stars, not because it earns them by itself, but because the overall series is worth 5 stars and this is but a part of it (though for what it's worth, the rest of the books are easily 5 stars on their own). So if you pick this up, be sure to plan on reading the second as well. If you don't enjoy that one, then the series isn't for you and you can stop.
A great read in a new direction. This is not your every day Stephen King book. A macabre western-ish dimensional tale of honor, revenge, wizardry, and advanced technology all at the head of a pin. I read this in the 90's and was hooked then, I just had to add this to my electronic library as a must have. Book 1 of 8, well 7 plus the newest a prequel "Little Sisters of Eluria". Enjoy the crazy train, I did!
Love My mind has always found the writings of Stephen King to be prodigious (and I know that I'm pretty far behind having just finished the first in this series) but this work has greatly exceeded my expectations of a truly talented man. Mr. King, I thank you.
So begins a refreshingly strange series...and thank God Those who have yet to read this series can consider themselves lucky not to have to wait years for the next book to come out. It's been nearly 30 years in the making, but it's been worth the wait. The Dark Tower series is refreshingly weird, with a great blend of fantasy and suspense. It's page-turning and one you'll want to re-read over and over. If you like fantasy, don't think about it, pick it up. This story's extremely unique and captivating.
Unique, surreal, and weird Disclaimer: My review may spoil the "plot" for some readers. The Gunslinger is definitely not my favorite Stephen King novel for a number of reasons. First, entering the world of this novel is notably difficult because a lot of events have already happened prior to chapter 1, so King has to tell a lot of the story in flashbacks. Even after he fills in some of the gaps, readers are left wondering why Roland must catch the Man in Black in the first place, a question that I don't feel is ever answered effectively. Second, it's not REALLY a novel; it is a collection of stories involving the same antihero. At times, Roland's journey seems pointless, making his betrayals of Alice and Jack feel cruel and unnecessary. Third, when Roland finally catches up with The Man in Black after a bizarre and seemingly pointless encounter with the Slow Mutants, he is given no real information, just a Tarot card reading with a deck composed of made-up cards. If King had used conventional and recogonizable cards, we might have been able to pick up on some deep archetypal message, but by including nonsensical cards such as The Sailor, The Prisoner, and The Lady of the Shadows, King undercuts any universal archetypal powers he might have invoked. By that point, though, I could have cared less. However, if you are looking far bizarre imagery in a dream-like narrative set in a illogical hybrid universe that seems to blend medieval Arthurian elements with spaghetti westerns, the Lord of the Rings, and Biblical allusions, then you will probably love The Gunslinger. It is way too surreal for my tastes, though.
Depressing without being interesting For me it incited no interest at all in reading the rest of the series. I loved "11-22-63" and have liked a few other Stephen King novels. The gunslinger may have survived the endless journey across the desert, but my interest didn't.
Great Book for Non-Stephen King Fans Most writers would be blessed to have one masterpiece in their careers - Stephen King has two: The Stand and The Dark Tower series. Rereading TDT (for the third time!!) was like coming home to good friends. King created characters so rich and adventures so vivid that you simply can't let go after the series ends. I've found that people who normally don't like King LOVE this series. I think it's a joy ride, full of highs and lows, joy and sadness, fun and suspense...and characters you really care about. (If you like books on tape, Audible does a superb job with the audio version -- great for commuters!)
A post-apocalyptic adventure with dashes of sci-fi and fantasy. ... A post-apocalyptic adventure with dashes of sci-fi and fantasy. "The Gunslinger" follows the title character as he hunts the mysterious "Man in Black" through a post-apocalyptic wasteland. King's novel leaves you with many questions, leaving you anxious to delve further into the series.
Stephen King's writings have always piqued my interest, but ... Stephen King's writings have always piqued my interest, but this book is a whole other beast. Set in a timeless desert with the mysterious Roland as the protagonist, I could not bring myself to put this book down. Before you know it, you're three chapters past the last place you bookmarked and it's 2:00am. Definitely a must read.
Beginning of an excellent series Having heard great reviews about this series, I decided to pick up the Gunslinger and really enjoyed it. It is a pretty short book, but I found that the world created by King was extremely rich and it really drew me in... I was especially interested in learning about the motivation behind Roland's relentless pursuit of the mysterious Man in Black. Again, this was a great book and the beginning of an enjoyable series!
captivating, if only because you want to know more. It sets the stage of a fantastical journey, only deepening one's appetite to know more about Roland, his "unique" mind, his quest and the way of the gunslinger. As it is said in the book, with more knowledge, more mystery is formed...well this book definitely does that. Lastly, the ending soliloquy of the matter and time and size is one of the most memorable excerpts I have ever read. Can't wait to read the next one.
Wow! I didn't really know what to expect. It was difficult to follow at first and difficult to put down later. I am really impressed and intrigued by the mention of size and infiniteness as it relates to spirituality.
Not compelling on its own I'm a huge fan of "The Stand" and have heard raving reviews of this series. This first novel in the series was very disappointing. The biggest issue I have is the fact that Roland's past isn't kept a mystery for very long and what is revealed is done in an uninteresting way. Things do improve in the latter third of the novel, but I really think there just isn't enough strong material to create an entire novel from. I won't be quitting on the series yet though. I have to believe people are rating this higher because of their love of the overall series.
Stephen King is Awesome. I read his books in college when I had free time and just discovered him again. I can't believe he wrote this first book at the age of 19. I am now reading the rest of the series and they are just great reads. Lost interest in Dean Koontz. He was just getting too preachy,paranoid and catholic for me.
The one that strated it all... He wrote this book in 1970(published in 1982) and it started the series that holds his whole literary universe together. A little tough to read especially if you have been introduced to King through his newer works, it is still by far one of his best. Once you read this book you will be compelled to get into the series. I highly reccomend the book and the series. But you don't have to take my word for it.
Roland These books are really interesting because the created cultures in them are fascinating, but the writing really tends to drag quite a bit. Sometimes to the point of it being hard to get through them. That being said the world is really really interesting so that keeps me going.
Tough to get through, but well worth it in the end The Gunslinger, the first book in Stephen King's epic Dark Tower series, is a somewhat slow, vague, drawn-out story about an old-west style Gunslinger traveling across barren wastelands. This book sets the scene for the seven-book series which follows. Books that prove to be an extraordinary epic. Get through this book and move onto the second of the series, they get much better from then on.
Even better the second time through The first time I read through the Dark Tower series they passed in a blur. While I can certainly name major characters and their actions, I really didn't remember the finer details that make the series something special. As I reread the series, I am noticing the nuance that will keep me reading and searching for a larger meaning.
Very good read Overall, I felt that the gunslinger by Stephen King was a very good novel. The mysterious tone of the novel and the mysterious characterization of the novel had me very intrigued and made this book hard to put down. In the first sentence of the book, “the man in black” is revealed as the antagonist in the book. Throughout the book, there are many examples that exemplify his hatred for this man, however the reader never figured out why the gunslinger is chasing this man, but there are some hints in the book. (Perhaps the answer will be revealed in another book in the series). At times, such as the events that took place at Tull, the gunslinger can be characterized as somewhat ruthless, especially when he ended his relationship with Allie. However, the book is centered around his chase for this man. In addition, the gunslinger develops a relationship with a boy named Jake. The gunslinger becomes a character that is more compassionate and caring. As this relationship develops, the more the reader cares about both characters, which adds more intrigue to the story as the reader wants to know what will happen to them. In addition to learning about the gunslinger, he tells stories of his past such as how he became the gunslinger and stories about his childhood growing up. This insight will answer many of the questions that you may ask yourself and once again, increases your feelings for the gunslinger. As for negatives, at times I did find the plot to be confusing as I had many questions to why things were happening. For example, I questioned why Jake is there as he is from a city that the gunslinger can hardly believe to be true. In addition, I did not love the ending. I do not want to reveal the ending, but the ending did not answer much and the gunslinger made a large sacrifice that I did not necessarily agree with. However, I did not yet read the second book, so maybe stephen King had a reason for the decisions he made. Overall, I felt that the book was very good and kept me interested throughout. I do not feel like this is Stephen King’s best writing, however his use of a mysterious tone had a very powerful and positive impact made the book very intriguing. I would recommend the book for anyone in high school and older who likes fantasy and I will definitely read the second book of the series. I read the unrevised version, but I would assume that the revised version would only be better.
A Strong Hero I've been a Stephen King fan all my life, and The Gunslinger was no dissapointment. The main character was very strong and memorable, and I'm looking forward reading the rest of the series. He reminded me a lot of the main character in the scifi novel, Twilight, by N. Stember, a character also thrust into a time and place out of the ordinary. I wholeheartedly recommend The Gunslinger.
The Whole Dark Tower Series This review is for the whole Dark Tower Series. Not just book 1. It's a true Magnum Opus by a master storyteller. Not many authors can drive you through a series this size and make you wish for more. It's a wild ride and a whole lot of fun. I would call it adventure fiction rather than horror, which is my true favorite genre, even if it's not treated as such by most marketers.
I rated this book 5 stars, however readers must ... I rated this book 5 stars, however readers must keep in mind that this book lays the foundation for a series of books. Stephen King accomplishes that with an expertise that rivals Robert Heinlein's future history stories.
Amazing This is my second reading of volume one of The Dark Tower. So many years have passed since I read it, that now I MUST read the following volumes again. I foresee many sleepless nights ahead of me, since I remember not being able to put the books down until completely overcome by exhaustion. King's life-long love affair with this story is remarkable. I can remember many times and many doubts about the release of the next volume, but never about the end of the story. This story will not truly end until long after King's end and the final review of all of his unfinished work and any notes that he leaves. I will not comment on my likes or dislikes of this volume. I wouldn't want to give away any of the story. It's a MUST READ!!! For those who haven't read it, prepare yourself by getting access to all volumes BEFORE you begin. You won't want any lag time between putting one down and picking up the next, even if it is in the middle of the night. For those who have read it, prepare yourself in the same manner. From one gentle reader to the next: ENJOY!!!
Good Verses Evil within the Grey Area.. Thought Provoking At first I didn't think I would enjoy this series but the more I continued to read the more it pulled me in and made me connect with the characters..especially Roland. The more read I can't put them down nor wait to see how all of the characters interact and become important to each other.
Fascinating Series, The beginning of a Grand Epic Fascinating introduction book to Steven Kings huge universe filled with quality, complex characters. This is a world that you will have many questions about and at times few answers. A world as mysterious as it is oddly similar to our own. Get to know The Gunslinger and his quest for The Dark Tower, it'll change the way you think about some things.
The beginning of my second trip to the Tower Second Reading was as great as the first... Perhaps better. Epic King! Because this is the first in a mighty series (some better, some not as good) I would not recommend this as a first read for King. For those that like the challenge, the series is rewarding.
A Masterpiece of literature I can't find anything wrong to say about this book. The foreward by SK, as well as the illustrations simply add to it's overall value. This writing, done by King in 1970, is genuine and enthralling. There is a timeless appeal to a story like this, and King is able to slowly build worlds both seen and unseen, while adding rich and believable characters that stay with the reader. An Imaginative landscape that has no boundaries, The Gunslinger is a classic that has stood the test of time. Whether you are new to King's work or have read many of his novels, this is a great place to start. I look forward to the next novel in the series. DW
Will Get You Hooked In the Dark Tower I: The Gunslinger we meet Roland of Gilead and follow him on his journey to find the object of his obsession, the Dark Tower and later in the series to finally confront the Crimson King. Once you start this book you won't want to put it down! I have read all the DT books that are out right now and believe me, once you get started you will be hooked.
Thrilled to read the revised version, excited to begin the journey again! I read the first 2 in this series more than 25 years ago, when I was still in my early teens. I fell in love with the story, and at the time only the first 2 books had been published. I waited impatiently until the third was published, and then bemoaned the time until the fourth. Years passed, I aged and my reading tastes shifted. I never returned to the series until a flu this season laid me low for several days. Bored with Netflix, and my 800 square foot apartment, I stumbled upon the revised version. Hallelujah! I recall the sense of getting drawn into the nether world of King's creation and can't wait to find out what else happens!!! Bravo!
The Gunslinger. How much do I love this series? Well, this marks my 21st reading of this series. Unlike some, I enjoyed the heck out of the first book, and all the books following. In this book we find out to what extremes Roland will go to in order to get to the Tower. It's only gets better from here folks! The Dark Tower as a whole is my favorite book of all time. For me, nothing ever come close to the storytelling, and the characters in this book. They've become my best, most loved characters ever. There's not a day that goes by that I don't wonder where Roland is, and what new friends he's made along the way. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a quest, great storytelling and characters so real that you feel you know them.
The mysterious beginning A wonderful and now rather lengthy tale, the Dark Tower series is Stephen King's greatest achievement. With the final two installments due out this year, I highly recommend you begin this engaging tale. It is complex, and begins rather mysteriously with little to no explanation for the current events, it is still well worth reading. HIGHLY recommended.
Slow at First This is an amazing book. It is very slow well over half but put the effort in and you will be amazed. And this book opens up a giant world as you read the series. Wild west meets Tolkien with some Sci Fi mixed in.
Very intriguing I decided to finally delve into this epic a few weeks ago. While the story told wasn't the best I've ever read, this book sets up for a marvelous tale. I'm very interested to continue reading the series! Recommend giving it a shot if you plan on reading on.
A slow start Book 1 in Stephen King's 7-part epic, The Dark Tower series gets off to a slow start with poor pacing and muddy storytelling in setting up his mammoth (from what I hear) storyline. The series does get better and becomes more interesting from book 2 and on from what I've been told so I'll give the next book a try to see what all the hoopla is about.
A little boring, but necessary I'm about halfway through the Dark Tower series after trying years ago and never getting into this book. The Gunslinger is a little boring, but is necessary to understanding the other books in the series. The rest of the series is worth it, so keep going and finish this one, even if it is weaker than the others.
slow and difficult I have read every Stephen King book but 3 and those are next. This is one of the worst. It took me a year to plod through this short book. That being said, by the time I finished I could not wait to pick up the next one in the series. I think of it this way, it was like the first chapter in a book of normal length. I'm about to start the last book in this series and just can't wait. To everyone out there who may have just read the first and gave up, DON'T. Keep reading.
Good begining, Good ending, Sleepy middle I first read this book in 1999, before I really did much writing of my own. I loved King at the time, but didn't find this one good enough to hook me into the series. As I wrote more and people found out my genres, more and more people said, "You got to read this series." So, I picked it up again a couple of months ago. I was sucked in by the main character's visit to the town, which was early on in the book. Then I grew quite bored and found myself going off in my head as I moved through the pages. It wasn't until the very end that it became interesting again. So I've started book two and am over half way through. So far, it seems much better. But we'll get back to that later.
okay in an averagely decent sort of way.... Synopsis/blurb..... In this first novel in his epic fantasy masterpiece, Stephen King introduces readers to one of his most enigmatic heroes, Roland of Gilead, the Last Gunslinger. He is a haunting figure, a loner, on a spellbinding journey into good and evil, in a desolate world which frighteningly echoes our own. In his first step towards the powerful and mysterious Dark Tower, Roland encounters an alluring woman named Alice, begins a friendship with Jake, a kid from New York, and faces an agonising choice between damnation and salvation as he pursues the Man in Black. Both grippingly realistic and eerily dreamlike, THE GUNSLINGER leaves readers eagerly awaiting the next chapter. And the Tower is closer... Well, I'm tracking my 18 year old son's reads as well as my wife's and this was one of the books he devoured recently. I have read the original probably 30-odd years ago when Mr King was top of the tree as far as my teenage self was concerned. Picking up the new and improved version, as apparently King updated it in the intervening period, wasn't a particularly pleasurable trip down memory lane, one filled with nostalgia and a yearning to instantly re-read about possessed cars, rabid dogs or scary clowns appearing out of road-side drains. I enjoyed the tale, as far as it went. Book 1 of 7, isn't going to finish with a neat resolution or conclusion. I was re-introduced to Roland the Gunslinger and found out about his apprenticeship and passage into manhood. We joined with him in his pursuit of the elusive man in black (not Johnny Cash, apparently) and along the way we killed a few people, ok a lot of people. This particular part of the journey or quest ends at the sea, with a link in to the second book in this 7 or 8 books series. King who could probably write his shopping list and have a host of people queuing up to buy and read it, is very skilled at crafting a story and making you want to turn the page to read more about a character that you are growing to care about......usually. I haven't yet reached that stage with Roland and I'm not having sleepless nights, anxious to read the next thrilling instalment. My son has a couple more of the books in the series, if he opens one up sometime soon I'll get to this after him no doubt. I reckon I may have read the second book in my earlier life as a slimmer, leaner, fitter, brown-haired, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed young man anyway. He has commented that the next couple are somewhat longer in length than this volume. King has a tendency to use 50 words on occasions where 1 or 2 would do, so I `m not pushing him to crack the spine just yet. FYI - I have just checked paperback length on volumes 2 to 7 plus the last published book, which sits between books 4 and 5. They are as follows; 406, 624, 896, 816, 480, 736 and a rather paltry 384 pages long. Overall, 3 stars from 5. I borrowed this one from my son, and I'm unsure where he picked it up from.
Great Sci-fi/fantasy without the neo-slang I have been meaning to read this series for years. King's writing style is intelligent and conversational. The story is Sci-fi without a cumbersome amount of futuristic slang that caused me to stop reading Necromancer. When I finished The Gunslinger, I immediately downloaded book two because I couldn't put it down.
Horror Novel Reviews: Honesty in the Terror I first read The Gunslinger: Dark Tower I (aka The Gunslinger) when it was first published back during the early eighties by Donald E. Grant, Publisher. This was done in the Limited, Signed edition format with a few thousand copies being printed as a trade hardcover for the die-hard Stephen King fans. I was certainly considered myself to be a die-hard fan at the time, trying to get everything I could of King's published novels and short stories. I ended up purchasing a trade hardcover of The Gunslinger to read and a Limited, Signed edition to wrap up and to keep safely tucked away. I wish I still had both of them. Stephen King first wrote The Gunslinger while still in college and then saw it eventually serialized in The Magazine for Fantasy and Science Fiction in the late seventies. The reason SK allowed Donald Grant to tackle the story and not a major publisher is that he didn't think the storyline or writing was designed for a large audience, but rather for a small group of his loyal fans. Of course, as time went by, word of mouth began to spread and more and more readers wanted a copy of The Gunslinger. Too, SK decided to follow the first book with a sequel, though The Gunslinger was originally written as a stand-alone novel. What actually followed were six more books and a seventh one that came out in April of 2012. Though the first four novels were written with long periods of time in between each publication, the last three books were written rather quickly. Also, Viking decided to republish the first four novels in hardcover with exceptionally drawn dust jackets and interior artwork by the great Michael Whelan, as well as artwork by other artists. A Trade Paperback followed afterwards. Because so much time had passed between the writing of The Gunslinger and the entire series, SK made the decision to go back and revise and expand the first book. This was probably a rather challenging project for him because he wanted retain the original voice of the young writer of the novel, while at the same time smoothing out the sentence structure, expanding on the background of the characters, and connecting the first book to the other ones in the series. With the seventh Dark Tower novel coming out in mid-2012 and Ron Howard signing on to turn the epic into at least three films and a unique television series (that idea hasn't been completely dropped by either Howard or the studios), I felt it was time to read the entire series, starting with the new, expanded first book. I have to be one of the few "Constant Readers" who hasn't read the entire collection. I read the first two in the series and then stopped with Wastelands. I remember writing a review of The Gunslinger for the Fantasy Mongers newsletter after the book first came out, raving about what King had been able to do in this parallel universe and with a character that was similar to the one played by Clint Eastwood in the "Man With No Name" movies. As to what the book was actually about, damn if I could remember. I'm old and my memory is fine on the best of days and not worth much on others. Anyway, I purchased the first four Viking hardcovers and the last three in the series under the Donald E. Grant publication logo. Then, they sat on my bookshelf while I debated when to start reading them. I mean some of these Dark Tower novels are five and six hundred pages long. This was going to be a major project. Finally, I started The Gunslinger, reading it as a much older individual than I had been in the early eighties. Just to get this out of the way, if someone were to ask me for a Stephen King novel recommendation, it wouldn't be The Gunslinger. I would tell them to try out The Shining or The Stand or maybe Bag of Bones or 11/22/63. I can't speak for the rest of the books in the series, but I don't think the majority of readers out there would enjoy The Gunslinger as much as his die-hard fans tend to do. That said, I did like the book and it still amazes me that a twenty-two-year-old originally wrote it forty years ago. The Gunslinger: The Dark Tower deals with the Gunslinger's (aka Roland Deschain of Gilead) quest to find the Dark Tower and his pursuit of the Man in Black, who appears to be an evil magician of some sort. We don't really know how long the Gunslinger has been after him, but I'm guessing years and that revenge is a large part of his motivation, though at the end it turns out to be more about knowledge and future events. As the book opens up, the Gunslinger is weeks, or maybe just days, behind the Man in Black. He is crossing the West and quickly approaching the opened desert that breeds little in the way of life. When the Gunslinger enters the town of Tull, he quickly discovers the Man in Black has already been through the tiny community and has left a few surprises. Needless to say, the Gunslinger barely makes it out of town alive as the residents rise up against him. Continuing on with his journey, the Gunslinger soon approaches a Way Station at the point where the harsh, looming desert is about to begin. There's a young boy named Jake at the station, and it appears the Man in Black snatched him from our own world and then dropped him off in the middle of nowhere just to slow the Gunslinger down. Whatever else the Gunslinger might be, there is a sense of compassion in him that refuses to leave Jake alone at the station. This compassion, however, falters at the end. Anyway, he chooses to take the boy with him on his quest, not knowing what will soon be in store for them. The trek through the desert takes weeks and soon leads to mountains and underground caverns that work their way through the granite and travel in the same direction as an underground river. Railway tracks and a handcar are soon discovered by the Gunslinger and Jake. This leads to a hellish journey through the blackness from one side of the mountain to the other. During this stretch of time, the Gunslinger begins to tell Jake a little about his past (things he's never told another being) and how he became a gunslinger. Also in the blackness of the underground caverns, the two journeymen will have to deal with the slow mutants (think of the mutants from The Time Machine). The mutants glow with green phosphorus and are hungry for some juicy flesh. The ending through the mountains is certainly a shocker. The final chapter deals with the confrontation between the Gunslinger and the Man in Black with long discussions about the history of the magician and why man's finite mind is unable to grasp the mysteries of the Universe. I think it was this last chapter that was expanded the most with many thought-provoking ideas concerning our place in the scheme of things and how little we truly know of our universe. Everything is eventually set up for the future volumes in the Dark Tower series, especially the second book, The Drawing of the Three. In the reading of this novel, I could easily see the shaping of a young, beginning writer into someone who would one day become a household name. I could see where Stephen King was going with the book, even if he couldn't when he first wrote it. I think in many ways King had no choice but to continue the series. He had given his readers a glimpse into another world and now had to fulfill the rest of the bargain he unconsciously made with his readers. If I have one question about the Gunslinger and the first book it's where in the hell does the man get his bullets from? You can only carrying so much ammunition on the holster belts, and I believe he went through most of those rounds trying to get out of Tull alive. Though there are a few other books I now want to read, I feel a strong tugging at my sleeve to jump right into The Drawing of the Three to see what happens next. That, however, will have to wait a while, but it's something to look forward to in the months ahead. Written by Wayne C. Rogers from Horror Novel Reviews.

The good, the bad, and the lonely... The Dark Tower series is one of the best things I've ever read. "The Gunslinger" is the first part and a little slower than the rest (also much shorter), but remember that it's just the beginning. Each step in the series is better than the last. Read "The Gunslinger" today and begin your journey to the Tower.
The Start of Something Great! I read this book a long time ago and I felt it seemed as though it was part of something greater. That something greater is Kings masterpiece series. I thought this book started off a little slow. If you are attempting to read this series, I strongly recommend it. The series was written in span of decades. In a way you can see the way King has grown with this series. If you are able to get through the first part of the book you are on to something special. The "Drawing of the Three" was by far my favorite of the series. Get ready for the adventure of a lifetime!
Not completely sold This book was a bit difficult to follow. There was a build uP to a really good storyline. I'm curious to see what's are the Tower. I Believe the next book in the series will be much better. At least i'm hoping it will be!
the edit Just read the King edited version. Nice, but I think I prefer the original that was recto need to fit with the later books and ideas in the story. It's not massive but the new bits, I think are noticeable. Still a great work and enjoyable.
Starts hard, won't say how the series finishes. I absolutely love this series, second time reading it. I won't say the end, but Stephen King outdid himself. This first book is somewhat hard to read and can draw along, but the following 6 (7 if you want to get technical with his latest addition) are gratifying. This is by far one of the best series I've ever read. And if you are able to conquer the novels, you will be rewarded. Enjoy this world Mr. King created, for it is grand indeed.
The Promise of Greater Things to Come One of the world’s greatest novelists brings, arguably, his magnum opus series The Dark Tower to life with the first of the series, The Gunslinger. The Gunslinger is one of King’s most imagined and thought out novels. There is no formula, little comparison with the other novels he has written, save for the feeling of uncertainty and fear that were reminiscent of The Stand. And there is the obvious link between Randall Flagg and Walter O’Dim. The story was slow to start and unlike many of King’s other books, readers have to work with the text, pay attention to not only the words on the page but build this world within your mind. There is a need for engagement with the audience that if it is not met, the story can be lost. Roland Deschain, the titular Gunslinger, is reminiscent of Clint Eastwood’s High Plains Drifter. He traverses a wasteland of uncanny, death and destruction in chase of the Man in Black. On the way he is distracted by mad preachers, demons and of all things, a human boy. The imagery within each of the sections of the first book is high fantasy and there are moments of the sublime that will make up for any moment of slowness. By the time we reach the final section and Roland catches up with the Man in Black, the narrative ascends to a whole new level. It is a pay off worth the slow start. And as the shortest section of the book (unfortunately), it leaves such promise for the sequel that you will want to continue on Roland’s journey.
Awesome Book! Looking forward to reading the rest! It's a fantastic book worth checking out if you're looking for something a little different. Roland is a pretty cool character and the writing is very intelligent and well-written. Plus there's a movie being made that might come out next year.
Take the journey! I loved this book, I have talked to quite a lot of people who didn't read far enough into this book to understand what the author was getting to. If you are reading this please, read it all the way through, if you do you will be hooked on this series as you follow not only Roland, that gunslinger of all times, but the others as they journey between worlds on an adventure of a lifetime or two! For me the thought of parallel world's is so intriguing, as a writer I add a lot of the into my books, but none to compare with the king of the story tellers.
Love this book and the entire series Love this book and the entire series. I first read the Dark Tower Series when they first came out. I couldn't put them down. They dominated my life because they were so engrossing. It is by far my favorite series of books ever. I am reading them again and look forward to the excitement. Good thing I'm getting older and can't remember everything from the first read.
Okay I agree with a lot of the reviewers on here that this book is very dry compared to other books by Stephen King. It was okay and I'm going to read the other Dark Tower books because everybody says their awesome. I really hope they are better than this one.
The best Book 1 is great Book 2 is Interesting Book 3 is interesting Book 4 is completely different, but arguably the best of them all Book 5 was long-winded and anti-climactic Book 6 was forgettable Book 7 has promise, but left me angry with myself that I had bothered to finish reading the series.
How about an actual sample of the book, Amazon? This isn't an actual review of the book. It's a note/forewarning to other potential readers of this book, especially those who prefer to TRY A SAMPLE before buying. I'd LOVE to write a review of this book, but first I'd be interested to know if I even WANT to read the book. **AMAZON:** Your offer to try a sample of this book is, at best, misleading and truthfully...it's an outright lie. The so-called sample is only the option to read the author's intro and note to the reader. As much as I have always enjoyed King's intros (I love the Dear Constant Reader intros) I actually would like to get a sample of the book itself before making the decision to purchase it. Maybe you could fix this, Amazon? I mean really....the author's introduction doesn't give me any feel for the story, or give me a hint of the style or plot. How could I possibly be expected to make the decision to purchase it based on King's explanation of how the story came to be, and his monologue on the edits and revisions that have been made over the years? I'm sure this is an oversight of some kind, but it'd be ever so kind of you to fix it.
Unique Fantasy Literature by the King of Horror The Gunslinger is the first of a truly epic series of fantasy books written by the indomitable Stephen King, master of horror literature. King has produced a series that now spans seven books as well as multiple one shot novels and multiple graphic novels based on the series. It has also produced, over the years, an army of fans and admirers, as well as several platoons of detractors. I, for one, cannot decide to which camp I belong. The Gunslinger, if nothing else, is an incredibly rich book and an incredibly unique book. The world into which we are dumped is one that is immense, dark, and even macabre (which is not surprising given the author's past books). It is a very effective strategy to introduce the reader to Roland abruptly during his quest to track down the Man in Black on his quest to find the Dark Tower. We are given no introduction to Roland's world. We are given no background story to this wan and almost disturbing protagonist. It is a jarring and not unpleasant experience. We are introduced to the mysterious Roland Deschaine through the interesting plot device of his story as told by himself to a stranger along his route to find the Man in Black. King uses the interesting and engaging farmer Brown and his crow Zoltan to coax Roland to tell his story as he sees it. This ploy allows us a glimpse into Roland from his own mind's eye. We see in his story to Brown about his visit to Tull the anguish and torment that Roland feels, as well as his unrelenting iron edge and true mercilessness. King produces such memorable and detestable characters as the weed-eater Nort, brought back to life by the dastardly Man in Black and the grotesque pastor of the town Sylvia. With Alice, the wilting barmaid, we get a very brief glimpse of the soft underbelly of Roland. We get a whiff of a past that promised young love, and young love lost with tragedy. With these characters, and their ultimate fate, we get incredible insight to this dark and lonely character with whom we will eventually become engrossed. The rest of the book deals with Roland's desperate and seemingly doomed trip across the desert to find this apparently evil Man in Black. Along the way, we meet a young boy Jake Chambers who rescues Roland from certain death. We learn that Jake is from another world, which as it turns out is the New York that we cannot help but recognize as our own. This passage is our first clue that the world we are in now is in some way connected to the world we live in. Jake becomes an almost Christ-like character en route to the confrontation with the Man in Black, and Roland begins to feel almost like a father to the boy. As they travel, they grow closer. Also as they travel, Roland realizes that he loves the child, which makes the line "Go then, there are other worlds than these!" one of the most haunting lines King may have ever written. This book produces a very vivid, but very shrouded world. We see a world that is unique and dark, and yet peppered by elements with which we are familiar. The characters are incredibly well written, equal parts detail and equal parts veiled in shadow and mystery. By the end of the book, we are desperate to know more about the Man in Black, Jake Chambers, and of course Roland Deschaine. This world is truly unique in the world of epic fantasy literature (while still choc full of blatant references to Tolkien elements). It is an interesting take on the Hero-on-a-quest style fantasy novel, especially when the protagonist and decidedly lacking in the classic hero characteristics. I do my best in this review to take the book as itself as well as its relation to the series. It can be hard to review a book as a part of a series, because you will invariably take into account the series as a whole when you review the book. As of this writing, I have now read four of the seven main books, and remain on the fence on the series as a whole. The Gunslinger is perhaps the best of the books so far, but it is by no means a stand-alone book. It contains a massive cliffhanger at the end (though decidedly not the biggest cliffhanger of the series as we will see in the next three books at least). There are some first novels that act well as a single book that do not require the completion of the series, but I would not consider this book one of them. For that reason, and for the reason that I'm not entirely sold on the series as a whole, I only gave this book 4 stars. Perhaps that is unfair, but I decided long ago that books in a series should derive rating based on itself and the series. Nevertheless, this book is worth reading by any fan of Stephen King who may be shying away from it because of its fantasy label. It is perhaps one of the most well written books he has written, on par and perhaps surpassing his more famous novels such as The Shining, Cujo, and The Stand. It is also very much worth reading for all fantasy book lovers as well for the dizzyingly unique world and non-traditional characters it produces.
not my cup of tea I need to care about the characters in the books I read, but these characters don't inspire any emotional response. If you like the old depressing Westerns, you may like this book. It was a short book, but took some effort on my part to finish it. I usually consume books, but not this one.
Not one of Steven Kings better works but enjoyable. Not one of Steven Kings better works but enjoyable. Not getting the next Game of Thrones volume any time soon, I was looking for a series to read. This fits the bill as I am a big King fan. I am eagerly awaiting the last and final volume of his Bill Hodges series as well. Too wordy and trying too hard to be mystical. Easy read.
Hoping Next Books are Better I've heard the first is the slowest, so I'm plugging on in the series. As a stand alone, this book was not one of King's best. Too much imagery clouds the actual story, almost to the point where you are re-reading to understand the progress of the story. He addresses his style in this book in the prologue, so I forgive him of this, and I've got my fingers crossed that the series improves.
Arguably the best of the series. Many Dark Tower (and King) fans seem to dislike this first DT story, but I found it to be the best of the five I have read. I stopped reading after Wolves of the Calla, because for me the series lost a little something with each new book. I've read a lot of King's stories, though I'm not a massive fan. Some things in his style tend to annoy me, like the constant references to baseball, or how most characters seem recycled from one story to the next. But Gunslinger, being one of his older stories, was something different. It's also comparatively short, which is good because it means it lacks the padding and plodding of many thicker Stephen King novels. Fans of dystopian fantasy westerns should definitely give it a go, even as a standalone story.
Read the series A good start to another world. The book can often feel confusing but it is worth it. Venture on with Roland with flashbacks and endless apocalyptic references. I found the series interesting and as usual King never fails to develop characters you feel drawn to.
Your first step into a larger world Book One of Stephen King's 'Dark Tower' saga. He draws you in with a protagonist that is both very compelling and deeply flawed. After a breathtaking adventure and a desperate chase Kind leaves the reader with more questions than answers. A quick read at just under 300 pages it is the smallest of the series but that by no means lessens its emotional impact.
Hile Roland! I used to tell myself, you will not read this book. My inner monolouge went something like this: self, if you dare lay a finger on this series, you will become the biggest nerd in the world. Reading fantasy epics now, are we? Ohhhho, what next, Orcs, trolls, Lord of the Rings conventions dressed up as Froddo and the gang? I taunted myself with these ideas, and fled from the Dark Tower as surely as Roland and co. did when confronted with the quest originally. Well, let me tell you, nerd I may be, nerd I have become, or if you like, Nerd I am, I like green eggs and ham...and I like the Dark Tower too, thankee sai. I have to tell you, when I first closed the dusty spine of The Gunslinger, my first thought was meh, it was all right. Not great, but readable, sure. But I'm fed up now, stuffed of the book, maybe ready to close the door on the epic forever. The next day I take myself to cycling class, and while I'm plonked down on the bike, with the cheesy mountains painted on the wall behind me, and sweat flooding into my eyes, I think: The dark tower's closer. I'm getting there...I am...oh God, why didn't I bring water?....Another hill?!! Cycle faster, I've got to get away from that man in black! Lovely, crystal clear moments like this when the book comes back to haunt my daily life make me know without a shadow of a doubt, how good it is. I had Roland on my brain for a few weeks afterwards. Roland, and his silly little quest for the Tower. But was it so silly? And does he ever find the dang thing? Little questions like that would flit into my brain at odd intervals, and I would think about that strange Clint Eastwood-esque fellow, out in the desert all alone, traveling across the sand dunes. Stephen King said Roland wouldn't leave his imagination alone, and he wouldn't depart from mine either. Next thing I know, I'm at the library, checking out the second volume.
Breathtaking and Surreal - Not to be missed! I will start out saying that this is my third time attempting to read the Dark Tower Series. The first time I picked up this slim volume was probably in 10th grade. It was a little over my head at the time but I really enjoyed the way it was written. That first time, I don't think I made it more than 100 pages into The Drawing of the Three and my Dark Tower introduction ended there. The second time was when I was broke and interning in New York City and I needed something to occupy all the time I was forced to spend in the apartment due to lack of funds. I picked this up again and got so much more out of it (this time reading it as a sophomore at Bennington College). This time, I made it all the way through the Waste Lands but never picked up Wizard and Glass. Finally, I made it to the third time which I just finished this week - in less than three days. Something about it this time really enraptured me. I could have finished it in one day but something felt good about slowing down the pace a little bit. In his new introduction, King wrote that the way this book was written felt very different than the rest of the series. This is actually what drew me in the most. I have never been an avid fan of Stephen King. I had read a few books like 'salem's Lot and From a Buick 8 but never really cared for him too much. I don't know what has drawn me in to this series so much but it really is amazing. I love the dark, plodding action that this first volume details. From everything I have read on Stephen King's other works, he is know for being very verbose. Even though this book is comparatively short when looked at versus his catalog of work, there is something to be said about the sparse way he brings us into Roland's world. Any writer can throw a million descriptions out to give the reader an idea of what is going on. What is so interesting is how King works with negative space in this novel. It is almost more about the lack of description rather than what is actually being said. Without a lot to go on, this creates an amazing fantasy world that is bleak, empty and apocalyptic without creating any cliche image of what this would look like. It is left up to the reader in a lot of respects. There is so much to be said about this wonderful book and a lot of it has already been said. All I can say is that the third time really is the charm. I will definitely finish the series this time. The story has drawn me in so much now that I can't imagine NOT finishing it. I have already finished The Drawing of the Three (again in less than three days) and can't wait to start The Waste Lands again. There is a reason why so many people are drawn to this series. What's great is that everyone has their own reason. So go ahead - find your own reasons why you never want to stop reading about Roland's quest for the Tower.
Introduction to the epic (MINOR SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW.) I decided that I needed some good literature to wash the bad taste left by the last series I read out of my pallet, so I recently picked up The Dark Tower series by Stephen King, all seven books. This book, "The Gunslinger" is the introductionary first novel that starts the epic of the Dark Tower. The Gunslinger is set in a world that is part post-apocalypic, part fantasy, and part western. It chronicles the journey of the mysterious gunslinger, Roland of Gilead, as he follows the Man in Black across a desolate wasteland. The best thing about this series is the worldbuilding. I very much liked the way the wasteland was developed and shown, and the touches of culture, and the metaphysical aspects of it. The universe (or multiverse, rather) that the Dark Tower exists in (which in turn connects to the rest of King's stories and universes) isn't seen until the final section, when Roland finally catches up to the Man in Black, though it's definitely worth it to come that far. The Gunslinger is well written, well developed, has some very good dialogue (especially between the Gunslinger and the Man in Black), a nice premise, a high level of originality, and a good story behind it. The book is almost as much about Roland's past as it is about the ongoing journey, and there are quite a few sections devoted to flashbacks and memories along the way. Not to say the book isn't without its flaws, however. If there is anything in the book I honestly didn't like, it was Jake. He was a completely flat character who couldn't have been more boring if he was intentionally written that way, and the only interesting thing about him was the implication that his presence in the Gunslinger's world means. (People from other worlds can enter this one.) Thankfully, he doesn't stay around for long. I can't remember the last time I've been so glad over the removal of a character. I also felt that was sometimes an unnecessary level of enforced mystery and ambiguity. Not mystery the way you see something unexplained and it's left unanswered until later, but the kind where the characters sometimes ignore what a normal person would talk about and avoid discussing what plainly needs discussing for the sake of ambiguity. Again, the story is helped with this problem now that Jake is out of the picture. The Gunslinger is a good first novel in The Dark Tower series and a solid read, though the presence of Jake and a few other problems will require a bit of patience. The second book is where the series really gets off, and is definitely worth getting to.
A great return to King After having completed all of Stephen Kings "horror" books I moved on to other horror authers such as Dean Koontz and Richard Laymon without giving a second thought about reading the Dark tower series as the fact that it was more fantasy than horror did not appeal to me at all. I had bought this book (but none of the others from the series) a couple of years ago but only read abot 20 pages before giving up. Last week, missing Stephen King books but not yet ready to re-read any of them, I picked up this book and thought I'd give it a chance since it was only 238 pages. At first I struggled and wondered if it was going anywhere, but after about sixty pages this book really picks up and I found myself unable to put it down, especially after the introduction of the boy, Jake. (And finding out how Jake got to be in the Gunsligners' world was one of the biggest surprizes i have ever gotten from reading a book - It was fantastic!) There isn't much of a storyline to this book as it was written as sort of a prologue to the Dark Tower series. The storyline is simply that a man know as the Gunslinger (who lives in a similar yet different world to our own) is travelling through the desert in search of someone - or something - he calls The Man In Black. Many other reviewers have said that they found this book dull but went on to really enjoy the rest of the books in the series so if you find this book hard-going please bear with it and try the next book in the series, The Drawing Of The Three, which I am currently reading and is even better than the first. I probably would have given this book five starts but I was so gutted when one of the charactors died (I wont spoil it by saying who) that I had to only give it 4 stars. If, like me, you are a fan of King's horror novels but are not sure about his other work, please give this series a try, you wont regret it!.
THE END-ALL OF FANTASY The First in the Dark Tower series, the Gunslinger Sets the stage for what will continue in the other books. The gunslinger, a cold, adventuring cowboy (the last of his kind), is on an eternal hunt to find the mysterious Dark Tower. To reach this destination, he must question a shadowy immortal of extreme power known only as the man in black. To this end, the gunslinger stops in interesting towns as he treks through a seemingly endless desert, the forest, and the ominous peaks that lead to the other side, where no mortal has set foot. He is completely absorbed by his quest, and has been trained to destroy anything in his way. For example, in Tull, a town in the middle of the desert, he brutally kills the entire town's population when a fanatical Christian convinces the rest of the generally friendly populace that the gunslinger is an agent of Satan. Another example is when he has the choice between taking his only chance to catch the man in black or saving his friend, a young boy from the past; he leaves his friend to fall to his death while the gunslinger catches up with the man in black. The plot is excellent and the ideas are fascinating. The many twists add a sense of uncertainty. The book eventually revolves around the concept of infinity, and the unerstanding of infinity by a finite mind. This concept leads into the Dark Tower, a representation of the entire multiverse in one, down to the smallest of possible dimensions. There are a few discrepancies in this book. One of them has to be the fact that the book rarely stays in chronological order. Suddenly shifting from a barren desert to a gallows in a remote part of the world twenty years in the past. Such shifts are common, but the book is usually not hard to follow. Another is the fact that is takes the reader fully halfway through the book before just to find his name. Even then he is referred to as "the gunslinger." This is an awesome book!!! YOU MUST READ IT IF YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF ANYTHING OF A FANTASY FAN!!!
Not my favorite in the series This is the first book in the Dark Tower series, and my personal least favorite book in the series. I read this when I was in high school, or was that junior high? Either way, I read this book when I was really young. I didn't like the story much then. It seemed like a painstaking process getting through the mundane beginning. Recently, I read the revised version of this book. The Gunslinger is the story of Roland of Gilead. Roland is a gunslinger in a world that is dead (or dying, depending on the reader's point of view). He is chasing the man in black, who Roland believes knows all the secrets of the Dark Tower. He plans on making this ambiguous man tell him what he wants to know about the tower. This story still started off pretty slow for me. I was almost tempted to put it down, but I stuck it out. The action picks up after a few pages though, but it's not consistent. You get a little action, then bits that could bore you to tears, then more action. It's not an awful read by far. This story is essential in introducing you to a desolate world, to Roland, to the man in black, etc. I really love how King can make the despair and desolation of the land so tangible in a reader's mind. I could imagine the land with a vividness. When I first read this, I don't remember feeling as blown away by some of the descriptions as I feel now. I, also, enjoyed how bits and pieces of the hero's life is scattered throughout the book. Though as my friend pointed out the book can be very confusing at parts. Sometimes, King would suddenly shift into a flashback, and at first, you wouldn't even realize it. Then, it could get quite wordy in a couple of places that didn't really need to be. A dictionary is a nice asset to have while reading this book, too. I had no idea what a poultice was until I read this book. Anyhow, I probably won't read this book a third time, but I enjoyed it much more this time. I always thought that King did a good job of mixing different genres (horror, fantasy, western, sci-fi) with this - and the rest of the books in the series. Not a bad revision for a novel that nearly ended up in my grandparents fireplace almost a decade ago.
"There are other worlds than these." Apart from being extremely jealous of Stephen King at the moment, because he has finished writing the Dark Tower series and knows how it ends, I am also deeply impressed at the continued depth and power he has placed in these stories of Roland, the last Gunslinger is a world that has moved on. The first time I read "The Gunslinger" I was in high school, and my young imagination was enticed and utterly enthralled by the world King had begun to build. Now, in this new revised edition of the book, King has done the same thing once again. He has added tantalizing new hints of foreshadowing to the Dark Tower story, and has really brought the first book of the series more in line with the rest of the volumes, sharpening up the language and providing more insights into the world (worlds?) Roland is travelling. In the new edition of "The Gunslinger," there are subtle twists in the story from the first page on. Readers already familiar with the world of the Dark Tower will find plenty of fresh meat to chew on here until the new books in the series are published. I believe that readers who are new to the series will begin with an even stronger sense of immersion into this story, as the expansions of plot King made will serve as a stronger bridge leading into the rest of the story. It is a deceptively simple story: Roland, the last hero of a dead way of life, pursues a mysterious Man in Black across a great desert. Along the way, we learn about some of the hardships he has faced along the way, even as the story continues with new adventures. Through this simple device, King begins the arduous, painstaking work of building the most complex world he has ever developed, and populating it with many interesting characters. Perhaps the most intriguing part of the revised edition is a new mystery which King presents us, in the form of the number 19. The number becomes a minor plot point in this revised edition, with strong hints that it will have significance later in the series. Apart from the mystery of 19, we have new insights into Roland's past, further explanation of who the Man in Black is and why Roland is pursuing him so resolutely, and more hints as to what lies ahead. King's Dark Tower series is a fantasy epic on the same scale as Tolkien's "Lord of the Rings," and it is every bit as compelling. "The Gunslinger," as the Man in Black reminds us in the final chapter of the book, is not really the beginning of the story. It is, rather, the end of the beginning. There is still a great deal of story to be told, but this revised edition of "The Gunslinger" is a stronger, clearer, more powerful way to enter the incredible world King has made for us. Highly recommended, Constant Reader.
The introduction to an epic, and all that entails "The Gunslinger" is the first volume of Stephen King's epic, seven volume, "Dark Tower" saga, and like the first volume in any series of books, serves primarily to set the scene for the later books in the series. As a result, very little happens in this book. We are introduced to our hero, Roland of Gilead, the last gunslinger, who is a cross between Clint Eastwood in "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" and Aragorn from "The Lord of the Rings", and follows him across the desert, over mountains and through an abandoned subway tunnel, in his pursuit of "the man in black"; a pursuit which culminates in the commencement of his journey to the dark tower. However, very little is revealed in this book. By the end of the book, the reader is still not told exactly what the dark tower is and why Roland is traveling there. We have to wait for later volumes for this information. I am generally a fan of Stephen King's writing. I think he is one of the most underrated authors of all time. Nevertheless, the multi-part format of "The Dark Tower" books just doesn't work for me. I have never been a big fan of multi-part novels, since the fact that the story is drawn out of such a large number of pages annoys me and makes me want to stop reading, and "The Gunslinger" is no exception. It is unnecessarily slow moving and could have benefited from a bit of editing. Another down point to this book is that it is essentially comprised of five short stories that are run together to form the narrative, making the storyline episodic and somewhat disjoint. Overall, I didn't hate this book and I think the idea behind this series has enough potential to make me want to read volume 2 sometime in the future, but I suspect that point in time will be the distant future, rather than next week.
Director's Cut I get nervous when things that are important to me get the "Director's Cut" treatment. George Lucas's relentless tinkering with the original Star Wars trilogy, not to mention those awful prequels, have managed to tarnish my love for that saga. I hold Stephen King's Dark Tower series in similar regard, so when I heard he was revising the first book, I was a bit apprehensive. At the same time, I was pretty curious. I'm a complete Tower junkie, so I knew there was no way I was going to be able to resist an updated Gunslinger. The Gunslinger was a tough read for me. I thought the original language was a bit too flowery and I had a hard time sustaining an interest throughout the book. I don't know what made me pick up the second book, Drawing of the Three, but I'm so glad I did. That book hooked me from page 1 and had me totally enthralled until the end. Since then I've been hooked. Apparently King had encountered this situation before. In the introduction to this book he described telling people that if they could get through the Gunslinger, the series got a lot better. So with this revised version, he has taken some steps to fix things. The essential story is unchanged. The characters, events, and timeline are all unchanged. At the same time, it was almost like reading an entirely new tale. The language was more in line with the rest of the saga, which made the book much easier to read, and there were several revisions that cleaned up the continuity and tied it in to later volumes. These revisions were understandable. King didn't have as clear an idea where the story would take him when he originally started the saga, and some of the supporting characters, locations, and events had changed since being mentioned in that first book.. All in all, I think King accomplished his goal. The book is easier to read, makes more sense in context with the rest of the saga, and should be much more accessible to new readers. Some purists may be disappointed. Much of the mystery and promise present in the first version seems missing from the new one, and the original language, while overly poetic, did add a romantic aspect to the book. So I'll hang on to my worn-out paperback of the original, while at the same time enjoying the "Director's Cut". One more thing. Am I alone in wanting to hear the full Jericho Hill story? It sounds like an epic, "blaze of glory" kind of tale.
Epic fantasy, blending horror, the supernatural, and adventure. I have just completed Stephen King's The Dark Tower. This is not a review for THE GUNSLINGER alone. It is for all seven volumes of The Dark Tower series, which should be read as one story. The Dark Tower, SK's magnum opus, is based on two fictional concepts: 1) Robert Browning's long poem "Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came" (provided in full in the Appendix of the seventh volume, THE DARK TOWER) and 2) Sergio Leone's series of movies starring Clint Eastwood as a gunslinging drifter. Is The Dark Tower worth reading? If you appreciate epic fantasy, yes. If you can tolerate occasional gaffs in writing style and convention, yes. If you despise horror, the supernatural, adventure, and action, and if you think such literature must be trashy pulp, no. THE GUNSLINGER introduces you to Browning and Leone's dual concept and to Jake. THE DRAWING OF THE THREE sets the mode: that of contemporary fantasy with portals to parallel worlds. And it introduces Roland's partners. THE WASTE LANDS is a good adventure in a parallel world. WIZARD AND GLASS for the most part digresses into Roland's past, but it is a superb story of romantic adventure. WOLVES OF CALLA stops along the way to the Dark Tower as Roland and his partners rescue villagers and display their gunslinging. SONG OF SUSANNAH is a story of unusual pregnancy, blending action and horror in a setting of modern America. THE DARK TOWER brings the long quest to a conclusion, with tragedy but also with ample good cheer. (Do read THE DARK TOWER'S Coda.) Though SK is one of contemporary humanity's more prolific, famous, and wealthy writers, do not confuse ability to sell with ability to write. I quail from the idea of every aspiring author trying to emulate him. For example he has a certain habit with concrete imagery. Stylists encourage concrete imagery, but SK gets carried away, at times making his prose feel phony and cheap. Mostly apparent in his descriptions of sex and violence, this habit pops up in other regards, as when he describes disease and excretion. In Writing Tools, Roy Peter Clark says, "Know when to back off and when to show off." With universally familiar phenomena like sex and excretion, we do not need detailed concrete images. Those are times to back off. Also, SK likes to show off his skill with offbeat jargon in dialog and character viewpoints. But this makes too many of his characters appear alike, and unconvincing. And SK can be a bit verbose. Especially in the later volumes of this series, he seems to follow Strunk & White's admonition "Delete unnecessary words" less than he follows the apocrypha "The thicker the book, the more impressive it is." Though I consider SK an occasional, worthy digression, I prefer standard prose, polished by authors (and editors) who pay close attention to Strunk & White's The Elements of Style. I award The Dark Tower five stars because I do not consider flawless prose a requirement and because The Dark Tower is a good story. Be it ever so, and I thankya.
Roland's Aim Is True & Instinctive The Gunslinger, by Stephen King The Master of the Macabre began writing this series of novels in the late 70's that dealt with a post apocalyptic world of guns, mutants and sorcery. The sensational saga began with this book, The Gunslinger; a weird hybrid of Western, horror, fantasy and science fiction. Roland is the main character, a deadly gunslinger on a quest to find the Dark Tower. Along Roland's journey he crosses the path of a strange assortment of characters and freaks. In one town alone he is forced to kill almost the entire population who relentlessly attack him as if possessed by vicious demons. During this engrossing encounter Roland unloads his trusty revolvers on the wicked and reloads them as if possessed himself. Sticking to the basics of the popular mainstream western genre Roland carries a pair of tuned 1873 Colt Single Actions he inherited from his father that are commonly referred to as the Peacemaker. It is a good description, for those looking down the barrel of these must quickly make peace with their maker... This is definitely an interesting beginning to an unreal and uncanny tale that took Stephen King decades to complete. This story and its series actually tie into a great deal of other books within King's horrific universe. Luckily for those with little patience or ability to focus on a book, Marvel Comics has been publishing an adaption that is illustrated pretty well by Jae Lee. I have read them all and have been pleased by how faithful to this outstanding series of books it has been. The luck continues because anyone interested could easily buy these issues in graphic novel form... all bound together and cheaper overall. This goes the same with an ongoing series of The Stand by Marvel Comics.
My review is good A review of Stephen King's "The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger." by Robert Tyler Gasperson. It has taken me almost seven years to sit down and actually read this novel. I was 13 or 14 years old when I checked out the audio tape from the library. I got about halfway through the first side of the first tape. Then I had to turn it off. It was too wordy for me at the time. The story moved to slow and the words were over my head. I was young and couldn't get interested in the story. I wanted things to move fast, to get interesting, instead of actually thinking about what King had to say. At the age, if I couldn't get through "The Gunslinger", I wonder what my thoughts would have been about a book like "It" or "The Stand". I think I would never have gotten interested in King's work if that was the case. I started this novel about three weeks ago, just reading in my spare tie. Now with an older mind and a little ore reading experience, my interest was sparked and just about couldn't put it down I took a trip with Rolland to the old man's house in the desert and listened as he told the story of how he killed everyone in the small city of Tull. I walked with him through the desert and watched as Rolland found the boy, Jake, at the Waystation. I observed the relationship between the boy and the Gunslinger as they crossed the desert and entered the forest. I watched as they chased the Man in Black. The first four parts of the book was just an intro. They told of the long Journey that Rolland took to find the Man in Black. It told of the past, how Rolland won his guns. It told of how the boy ended up at the Waystation. The chapters also explains some of how our own planet Earth is connected to Rolland's home world. These chapters tell of the magic that fills the lands. They tell about the entities that scour the surface for the food that they desire. They also give all the details about the life of Rolland. The final chapter is the essence of the book, or even the essence of the universe. The Man in Black meets the Gunslinger with the anticipation of telling him what he needs to know to complete his quest for "The Dark Tower." The Man in Black went to explain the finite essence of Rolland's mind. He explains how much more there is to the universe or, more than that, universes. In the words of the Man in Black he says: "Imagine the sand of the Mohanie Desert, which you crossed to find e, and imagine a trillion universes - not world but universes - encapsulated in each grain of that desert; and within each universe an infinity of others. We tower over these universe an infinity of others. We tower over these universes fro our pitiful grass vantage point; with one swing of your boot you may knock a billion billion worlds flying off into darkness, in a chain never to be completed." When I read this, I thought about it. I have had this kind of thought before. I always wondered what was beyond the proton, neutron, and electron. What if there was a universe inside each particle. It could even get smaller than that. Each atom in that universe had universes in its particles and so on and so forth. Mind boggling isn't it. I would have to give this novel three out of five King points. There was not enough detail and interest in the first four chapters, yet the final chapter did very well.
When Evil Becomes us. Long time SK fan but I don't know why I haven't read this series before. Such a good story, the gunslinger presents details of events that could have been the results of our own misgivings. Excellent read. Eagerly awaiting the next book in the series.
Highly Recommended Having the read the entire series but book 1, it was like revisiting a good friend. I read that the author re-wrote the book to reflect what the series became so I do not have a reference for what the book was like originally. That being said, taken from a new reader perspective, it was worth the read and put it out a few pieces in place that I was lacking in perspective.
Re-read after about 20 years I like the edits, though I now want to compare my old paperback to this version to see where they really actually are. Even without knowing very specifically, I felt like this was easier to read and tie in to the whole story than when I read it the first time though I guess that could also be my own age and hindsight working too!
I really loved the world and the story about the people in ... I'm not a King fan, and this is only the third book of his I have read. I didn't really get into it. I really loved the world and the story about the people in it, but I couldn't really feel much for the main characters. I don't know what it was. But, I have the next one in the series, so I will give it another shot.
A Great Opening to What I Hope is a Great Series. Just finished this one and bought Book II immediately. This is a book that opens lots of threads that I expect will be resolved over the rest of the books in the series. Despite all the threads this book opens, it holds together well as a novel and is a compelling read. Stephen King is a wonderful story teller and this book is no exception. It feels like the Series will build into something really special, but for me, it's early days in the series and we'll see how we go...
Not so classic Stephen King I had read this book years ago but wanted to reread it prior to reading the rest of the series. A truly enjoyable story where you really don't know what's going to happen next. Not what I expected from a Stephen King book, but that's what makes him a great writer; the unexpected.
Not sure if one calls this fantasy, scifi, or something else - but definitely call it entertaining! This is the start of an epic journey. We are introduced to Roland, a “gunslinger,” the last “gunslinger.” The world has “moved on,” leaving he, and his kind, behind. This book accompanies Roland on the early stages in his quest to reach The Tower. I cannot imagine missing the opportunity to continue joining Roland through his quest, through the seventh book, though I must admit that the books began to regress exponentially after the tremendous first four books.
I just love the story telling aspect and how it is a ... I read this book years ago when i was a teenager. Recently i became interested in the series as i wanted to finish it (i only read the first four). I just love the story telling aspect and how it is a science fiction western. the imagery, conflict, character development - all of it i just really really like. Very quick read. If you fly through this - i would imagine you will be buying book number two right after.
Love Stephen King, but not this book. First off I am a huge Stephen King fan, but this book did not hold my attention. I did not really understand where the storyline was going even to the last page. There probably is a great storyline in there but It was a little too scattered and vague for me.
the best of the series I had never read a stephen king book when i first read this, 10 years ago, and i was certainly skeptical. Long story short, I was blown away by the style and how captivating the story and characters were. The world's concept alone is mind blowing: wild west meets post-apocalyptic meets King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table meets the Wizard of Oz. It's crazy stuff. This is a truly great story and, in my opinion, the best book in the series.
Worth the Effort! Took me a little while to get into the Stephen King mind set but I was glad I took the time. If you read the introduction called "19", then you are somewhat prepared for a slow moving saga. In fact, the length of the intro alone made me hesitant to get started. Stephen King takes his time setting the scene for what is going to be an epic journey. Sometimes I felt as if I was watching a movie that was moving too slow. However, I persevered and by the end I was hooked. Could not wait to get the second edition. I found the character of the gunslinger well developed and the quest established, but with enough mystery to hold my interest. This was my first Stephen King book, so I did not know his writing style. The vivid imagination with good twists and turns made sure that as, a reader, I was pulled slowly into the story. What I liked most was the slow realization that I was wanting to know more and more about what was going to happen, while at the same time really enjoying what was presently happening. It is similar in a way to the Lord of the Rings, in that it takes some time to create the basis for what will be a long and involved tale. If you read reviews, like I do, to see if you want to read something, then be prepared to relax and not rush, as the end will be a long time in coming. But, as I said in my opening. It is worth the effort!
Surreal, Supernatural Science Fiction 4.5 stars. "The Man in Black fled across the desert, and the Gunslinger followed." With this line, the first book in The Dark Tower series was born. After having read this book at long last, I can see why Stephen King views this as pretty much his masterpiece. With rhythmic, beat-poetry-like narration and a surreal, almost hypnotic setting, I can honestly say that while I had no idea what was happening with this book (I'll explain), I loved every paragraph along the way. Roland Deschain is a gunslinger, of the Wild Western lot, and possessing an almost sacrosanct duty to keep peace and order in his land. He is the last of his kind and has spent as long as he can remember chasing the man in black, and, more importantly, the elusive Dark Tower. The setting of this book was surreal, a somewhat transcendental afterlife which had elements of the romanticized Wild West--desert, saloons, gunfights--mixed in with stylized speech patterns and bits of details long forgotten, taken from present day. The effect is an air of "otherness" which gives this book a very distinct feel as the story progresses. The main character, Roland, was one of those dark, mysterious figures that plays things close to the chest, has an array of deadly talents, and has the quiet authority that duly impresses. Quite simply, he reads like a badass, and proves how much he is one throughout the book. At the same time, however, there are moments of clarity in which the reader can see how human the gunslinger is, particularly in contrast to such an inhuman wasteland that serves as backdrop for this book. It was very easy to feel for the character, despite how hardened he was. While certain elements weren't really made clear--namely what, explicitly, the Dark Tower actually was--it's the open-endedness of that question that keeps you turning the pages. The newness and the compelling characters certainly kept my interest; however, the rather nonlinear plot left me wondering what the point of the story was, if there was one. By book's end, I wasn't sure if I'd found an answer to that or not, but I still feel compelled enough by the story to give the second book in the series a try. A haunting combination of science fiction and horror elements, The Gunslinger is hands-down a well-written and fascinating book.
Interesting story I have always heard about the Dark Tower series, and finally decided to get it. Although you can actually feel how young King must have been when he wrote it, is a very intriguing tale, with an easy narrative, and a compelling in-universe. Good enough to get the next one and keep reading.
Cup of tea... I have tried for a long time to like Stephen King... starting quite a few books (simply because all my friends read him) and seldom finishing them. This was no exception. I guess this simply isn't my cup-of-tea style of book, although I assume he is a good writer.
Sometimes slow, always fun, genre hodge-podge from Stephen King. There aren't a whole lot of books like the Stephen King's Dark Tower. This story blends together fantasy, science fiction, and even western to form one wild ride where you never know what is going to happen next. This series stars Roland Deschain, a knight from the fallen kingdom of Gilead who wields two .45 caliber revolvers forged from (we later find out) Excalibur itself. The story begins with him stalking someone known only as the Man in Black through a (post apocolyptic? Fantasy World? Other Planet?) desert. That may be the most interesting premise I have ever typed. I won't lie, this book can be very slow at times. There is a surprising amount detail spent on describing walking around for such a small book. But when King gets into action or dialogue, the book really comes together. Fights are exciting, and conversations between characters are a joy to read. If you like this, be sure to check out the sequel, which I feel is the best in the series.
An excellent start The Gunslinger is an excellent introduction to a series that will surely be a classic. The Gunslinger flows smoothly and captures your interest from the start. Don't expect all your questions to be answered by the end of the book! There's six more to follow it for that! The Gunslinger is fast and easily-flowing read that I couln't put down. Should be 4.5 out of 5 stars, but the system doesn't take half stars.
A MUST READ FOR EVERYONE!! If you don't want to devour the next 6 books after reading this one, then stick to the newspaper because this is one of the best books ever written by Stephen King. I have read all the Gunslinger books before and I will re-read them many more times in my lifetime. I also recommend them to every reader I know. Make that anyone who can read. You don't have to call yourself a reader to get through this book. The plot will pull you in and you'll be up late reading it every night because you cannot put it down!!
The Beginning of an Addiction The Gunslinger was the second book I had ever read by Stephen King. When I bought it I didn't know the extremely large following the series had, or even the fact that it was part of a series. After reading it, I was addicted, and delighted to find out that there were more books to continue the saga. King uses the parallel worlds and timescapes to create a massive domain for his characters to move about in. Along the way Roland (the main character and last of a dying breed of skilled fighters) meets Jake and down their path they meet many obstacles, such as the Wizards (Merlin and Marten) and are forced to use the deepest parts of their souls and minds to fight through. There are many flashbacks, visions, and hallucinations that tell a lot of interlinking stories with the story, and are very important to the journey to the dark tower. Sometimes these parts will confuse the reader, but if they are grasped, they enhance the novel greatly. This book will not only entertain you, it will make you feel as though you are walking through the barren desert, right beside Roland himself. Be prepared to buy the rest of the series once you read the first book, because you will not be able to stop. Currently I await the paperback of the next book to be avaible. (I would have the hardback but I bought the other four in matching paperback and I'm a geek like that) I know that anyone who reads the first books will be dying to have their hands on the rest sooner than they know it.
Roland of the dark tower I have read this book a half a dozen times and it still as great as the first time I read it...I've read the entire series and in a way it makes sense to start over again 😊.......so once more into the breach I go.
Intriguing The writing is good, solid King, without some of the repetitive unilateralism of his lesser works. But like Green Mile, he is slowly weaving what may become a great story. Am I hooked? Almost. I do want to continue this journey with Roland.
A couple of interesting things happen, but it's mostly vague. We don't know any why's yet. 3 STARS FOR THIS BOOK 1 IN THE SERIES. This is not a stand alone book. It sets things up. It is set in the future in an apocalyptic world. There are no cars, probably because there is no gas. In this book a gunslinger is walking with a mule in the desert. He has sworn to go to the Dark Tower - don't know why. He is following a sorcerer whom he believes can tell him how to get there. Gunslinger carries two revolvers. He is an excellent shot. He has excellent insights into people. There's a short back story about when he first became a gunslinger. The narrator George Guidall was fine, but he's not as good as Frank Muller. DATA: Narrative mode: 3rd person. Unabridged audiobook reading time: 7 hrs and 24 mins. Swearing language: strong including religious swear words but rarely used. Sexual content: A few sex scenes are referred to, no details shown. Setting: apocalyptic future in the U.S. Book copyright: 1982 and 2003. Genre: apocalyptic fantasy. -------------------------------------------------------------- 3 STARS FOR THE ENTIRE 8 BOOK SERIES: One of the books is number 4 ½. The last book is number 7. The main character is Roland, a gunslinger, inspired by the Clint Eastwood character in his spaghetti western movies (ex: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly). Roland is on a journey to the Dark Tower to stop evil forces from destroying the world. The books should be read in order. There are many wonderful ideas and stories. There is also too much clutter, rambling, and things I think should have been edited out. The Harry Potter series was better because everything developed the characters and moved the plots forward. Here at times I felt the author was writing short stories and getting off track. Overall I'm glad I read it. And there were a some wonderful parts that I will remember. I was disappointed with the last two books. Instead of enjoying the journey, I wanted them to be over. I did not like Roland's ending. It left a bad taste in my mouth. There was such potential and it felt piddled out. I liked one reviewer's comment "in his rush to end this series the author has given up its soul." (Amazon reviewer Roger FitzAlan "Aranarth") Although not necessary, you might be glad to read The Stand before reading this series. The evil guy in The Stand (Flagg) continues being evil here. I really liked what happened to him in the first half of Dark Tower book 7. Throughout the series there are snippets of characters from various King books, but nothing to recommend reading those books first.
The first book review Stephen King really is compelling when it comes to writing and this book proves it. Although it may be confusing, Book 1 of the series is a lot of excitment and does`nt stray too far into a cliche. The book does happend to go into flashbacks without warning with Roland the anti-hero of the story and it can feel jarring. That seems to be the only flaw with the book. However, King does impress us with how compelling Roland can be and his relationships with a character are always a suprise and unexpecting. Also, just when the story starts to feel boring, King thoughtfully gives us a big climactic moment that makes you want to read more. Book 1 did a fine job and I hope Book 2 of the series manages to peek the level of talent and excitment that this one did.
Couldn't put it down I have been reading Stephen King for 20years now but always resisted the Dark Tower series. Partly because it didn't seem like "real" Stephen King to me, and partly because of the cult following behind it. But always in the back of my mind I thought- later. Sometime later in life I will get around to it. Well that time is now. Started the first book on my kindle yesterday and found myself not wanting to put it down. Became enchanted.by the vivid imagery and loved it. Now on to the next.....
A Great Introduction to the Series The Gunslinger introduces us to Roland, a man on a mission to return his deteriorating and desolate world back to the glory that it once had. To do so, he must first catch the mysterious man in black, and Roland treks vast distances in order to catch him. Facing a forbidding landscape along with a few traps left behind by his enemy, Roland has no easy time of catching his prey. This book excels on almost every level. Although the characters are few in number, they are set up and described so well that you can't help but be drawn into their lives, especially Roland and Jake. The descriptions of the lands that Roland travels through are also spot on. King truly paints such a vivid picture of Gilead that a movie adaptation would probably never do the book justice. I read a lot of reviews about people saying they don't really like this book compared to the other Dark Tower books. It is different, but this is the one that really drew me into the Dark Tower series. It's here that you see what a solitary, tragic, unique figure Roland is. After reading this book, I just had to know if Roland would complete his quest. I've read the original many times, and read this new version a few months ago. The update makes small changes here and there and also fixes some problems that used to conflict with the later novels. If you give this book a try, you can't help but read the next book in the Dark Tower series.
Weird, but great. I tried and failed reading this when I was in middle school. the world and the prose was beyond me, so after finding it in Half Priced Books on my most recent vacation to Texas, I snapped it up. Read it in two nights. Love it. Weird-west meets the afterlife, meets sword and sorcery. The biggest compliment I can give the book is that it's inspirational, and makes me want to throw my hat in the ring in terms of the genre. I took a star off because the prose is quite awkward at times, and King leaves a LOT for you to infer based on odd language interactions. Entertaining, but it can be laborious. Recommended, but make sure you have some patience.
Failed to hook me The imagery in this novel is awesome. The bulk of the story is in a western style post apocalyptic desert. There's saloons, gun fights and creepy abandoned towns. The Gunslinger also had flashbacks that took us to some kind of medieval-style fantasy world and we even meet a character that took us back to current time New York. I couldn't figure out how they all fit together though. I spent most of this story trying to piece together details to help me figure out the plot. Roland, The Gunslinger, is on the tail of The Man In Black and chasing him through the desert. I think he is chasing him to find some kind of tower. I am not sure why we want to find The Tower. The book is full of creative details that I spent too much time trying to figure out in hopes that they might be connected to the plot. For example, in this futuristic world, poker is called 'Watch Me'. It took me half a chapter to figure this out and it added nothing to the plot! I was starting to have a hard time turning the pages. There wasn't enough back story to explain what was going on. Roland also had a very disconnected character and in the beginning I took this as part of his 'bad ass take no prisoners' persona. Then we get introduce to the kid and I realized that the characters are just underdeveloped. I felt no heart ache in their moments of loss and I should have. The reader spends the entire book chasing after The Man in Black to find The Tower. We never find out what The Tower is and we never find it. Very unsatisfying. Stephen King failed to hook me with this first book and I won't be continuing with the series.
This Book is Intriging but The Gunslinger as a stand alone book would have been 5 stars. Unfortunately it is 1 of 7. If you are planning to read this as a series I would recommend you look to the reviews of book 7. I finished what I started, but the end was much weaker than the begining. If this is Mr. King's hope to match the greats of Sci Fi Fantasy, he has been measured and found lacking. As a side note, I really don't have enough interest in Mr. King's "On being Nineteen" to read it in each of the first four books. Reading it once as the kindle free sample was quite enough and should be warning enough of tales to come. This was added well after the original book was written.
Not What I Expected Interesting book. However, from the authors own forwad I expected something more "Tolkienish". It should not in any way, shape, or form be comparede to "Lord of the Rings". It is definately the author's own style - with a science fiction/fantasy twist. That being said I certainly liked it enough to order the second book in the series!
Good but not for me My brother was a huge fan of the Gunslinger series, but I never quite got into them. I read the first one—this one—but didn’t feel compelled to continue on with the series. It wasn’t that there was anything wrong with the book, per say. It was more just a matter of preference. The Gunslinger (The Dark Tower) is essentially a fantasy series like Lord of the Rings, except darker with a western-type angle. Honestly, it just wasn’t the type of book I ordinarily read. That said, it did a good job of building suspense, it was dark and creepy at times, and the flow was good. If you are into fantasy novels, especially dark fantasy, you may want to give this one a try. As for me, it just didn’t grab my attention enough for me to want to continue onto book 2 in the series.
gets better toward the end As much as I like horror, I've never read King's The Dark Tower series, so I thought it was time to start. The series begins with The Gunslinger, a book that takes place in a nightmarish-post-apocalypticish-wild-Westish setting in which a gunslinger named Roland is following a mysterious figure known only as the man in black--with passing references to a dark tower. At first I was irked by being thrown into the tale without a full understanding of what was happening. It slowed my interest initially, as I had to piece together bits from the present as well as Roland's recollections of his past. But as the tale progressed, I came to enjoy discovering the elements of Roland's world, and when the book ended, I ran to my keyboard to order Book Two. What I enjoyed most was the balance between mystery and fatalism. It seems that characters know--if only subconsciously--what is to come and what has come before. Along his journey, Roland encounters (among other things) a boy named Jake. He and Jake travel together, though they both sense that Jake will end up being sacrificed in the end. There is also the suggestion that the man in black, while somewhat elusive, is making sure Roland catches him. Jake makes references to things he doesn't quite understand, things like movies and subways from a time before the world moved on (and this, despite the fact that he also makes references to having already died in such a world). The last chapter makes up for any confusing scenes in the beginning, insight coming like fireworks even as more mystery develops. I won't give away much--only to say that the dark tower sought by the gunslinger is the crux of it all, and it's something he doesn't find in Book One. The ending definitely leaves the reading longing for the next book in the series (so watch this space for an upcoming review!). Finally, as an English teacher and writer, I enjoyed King's Afterward, in which he reveals some of the history behind his writing of the novel, including the fact that he was inspired by Robert Browning's poem "Childe Roland."
The Beginning of a Great Story I've been a fan of King's work for quite some time now. I bought 'The Dark Tower' when I was younger. I started it, and could not get into it. I recently picked it back up, and tried again. I'm glad I did. This book drops you right into a fantastic world that has some faded similarities to our own world. And in other ways, this world is completely alien. King does a few refreshing things here. For one, the world has not 'ended' or 'died.' The world of the gunslinger has 'moved on' and left humanity behind. Its an oft-repeated phrase throughout this novel, and the novels that follow. The gunslinger is the last survivor of the last civilized culture, which has since perished, along with the gunslinger's friends and family. Despite how cliche that might sound, the character of the gunslinger is intriguing. He's a deeply conflicted character: deadly purpose incarnate, but with honor. He seeks The Dark Tower, in a world that has 'moved on' - and nothing will stop him. The ending of the novel is really just the beginning of this tale, and for readers who aren't in it for the long haul, it may be disappointing. It just made me want to get on to the next novel. I read the first three of this series in 2 weeks; ravenously devouring one after another. Now I'm anxious to start the fourth book. I highly recommend this book, and those that follow.
King of Classic Like he promises in the intro that this book was inspired by the likes of The Hobbit, certainly King's gunslinger takes us on a noble quest that keeps the pages turning. Fastest book I ever read...maybe fast as the gunslinger's fingers.
The best of the bunch This is the book that grabbed me by the throat and got me to read through the entire series. I found the rest of the books spotty – sometimes brilliant, but frequently silly, off-track or even boring, but this first volume is the best thing I’ve ever read from SK. That it’s a shorter book than the bloated volumes that follow probably helps. (I should say I read the original version as serialized in the Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction – perhaps I’d find the revised version less to my taste, I don’t know.)
A Slow Start, but Promising Future The Gunslinger was unlike anything that I had read before. I had gone into it with high hopes because I have heard great things about the entire series from numerous people whose opinions I trust. I was... confused upon reading it. The pacing throughout the entire books is askew and seems to have no rhyme or reason to it. It starts off interesting, becomes a bit tedious, goes back to a quick pace, slows down again, etc. Parts of Roland's story, such as his past, were very interesting and the only thing that kept me hooked on the story. But, there are only so many times I can hear about his traveling the baron lands and nothing happening. It honestly seems like parts of the book were written by two different people because of how poorly they mesh. King is a great story teller, that can't be doubted. But for some parts of this book he completely swung and missed. By the end of the book I was unsure whether or not I wanted to continue to the next book in the series. I wasn't in any danger of not finishing the book, but then again that is almost never a problem for me because I just like to finish a book if I start it. The end though did leave off at a promising spot that I hope leads to a more solid series overall. There is plenty of intrigue in the premise of the story, and I have no doubt it can turn into something great. The trick will be to improve the narrative before putting the reader to sleep and having them miss those good parts. I'm leaving this with a 3/5, but I will continue on to the next book in the series still optimistic. I don't think everyone would have led me wrong, and King has been tested time and time again while proving to be a literary genius.
A story fitting of a Master This is by far Stephen King's greatest accomplishment as a writer. If you give up on the the Gunslinger or give up on the series after the first book you will miss so much, read them all and treat yourself to an amazing reading experience.
The Start of King's epic series (some spoilers, so beware new readers" When I was 14 I bought the paperback of this book for a book report. I'm one of those kids who didn't like reading. So I just skimmed through the book and took down character names and made believe I knew what the book was about lol. Years later when I was like 24 or 25 I got into fantasy books, starting with the Lord of the Rings trilogy. After being done with those I wanted more fantasy. So I asked people what they'd recommend and so many people recommded Stephen King's Dark Tower books. So I figured I'd finally read that book I faked reading years before. This book was captivating and got me into King books. I always had them in my room incase I ever got interested in actually reading lol. This review I think is of the older version. Since I heard there's a newer version that's a little different. So don't blame if I mis-lead you in anyway. The book is about a gunslinger named Roland who is on the pursuit of an evil mysterious man he nicknames the Man in Black. Roland has an obsession for something called The Dark Tower. He knows that he needs to catch up to the man in black before he continues his journey to the Tower. He knows he has information he needs to get there. Think that's how it goes anyway since I'm on book 6 now and haven't read this one in awhile. He stops at a town that the man in black was at first. There he meets a scarred women named Allie. She's married but the two get together anyway. Which doesn't go well with the husband of course. He also meets a heavy nutty preacher women named Sylvia Pittston. He sleeps with her too but not out of attraction. She has information he wants. Soon though awful things happen in that town. The man in black some how made the whole town go nuts in-order to slow Roland down. They all go after Roland, even the children. Since he has a trigger finger he can't control he kills everyone in sight. Even poor Allie on accident who was the only one not possessed by the man in black. Shortly after Roland narrowly escaping that town he meets a boy named Jake who isn't from his world. Roland finds out how he got there by putting him under hypnosis. Some how he got there after dieing from getting pushed in front of a car. Jake who's scared and lost without Roland joins his quest to find the man in black. After that we get a flashback of Roland's teenage days. We meet his friend Cuthbert for the first time before reading about their adventure together in Wizard and Glass. We also learn how Roland faces his instructor named Cort inoder to become a Gunslinger. Back in real time, Roland soon has to choose between Jake or the Tower. I'm sure I left a lot out but that's good because I don't want to spoil everything. It's good to have Drawing of Three handy when you're done with this book. Because you'll probably wanna start on it as soon as you finish this book. The book is shorter than all the others. The books after it are full of a lot more action suspense and fantasy. This book is still incredibly cool and gives you a small idea of what you're instore for.
Good book! Read it if you get the chance. Overall, I thought it was a good book. I read it because my friend recommended it to me. It's not normally the kind of book I would read but I actually liked it. Definitely read it, if you get the chance.
Profound Fantasy (though really...sci fi?) This is not your average fantasy novel. It has magic and monster, but none of them seem very fantastic. Stephen King manages to make all of this seem real. Because everything else is made so real from his writing. At times, though, this backfires and you finish a paragraph thinking "wait...what?" The details acting a little too much like distractions or detractions. There are some very profound themes though, but even if these are ignored or not fully understood, the sheer drama is worth the effort of reading. Especially because, now, you get to read the rest of the series (much better written).
Liked this book - ended up HATING the series I have tried 2-3 times in the last 15 years to read this book and I always put it down because it seemed so boring. I've heard so many people rave about the Dark Tower series, I decided to give it another go. This time I couldn't stop reading, I guess I never gave it a fair shot before. I have heard that this is the weakest book of the series, but I still thought it was great. I cared about the Roland (even after he does something despicable), found the backstory really interesting, and was left with a hundred questions (that I hope get answered)
Great Literature, Okay Book This is far from a bad book, but I just personally wasn't a huge fan. The writing is great, and the world in original, it's a fantastic piece of literature, but I just didn't enjoy reading it. I couldn't really get into it, and this was perhaps because of the very round-about style of story telling. By this, I mean that almost nothing happens in the present, with all of the exiting things occuring in flashbacks. I also found the writing to be a bit pretentious, and I didn't like the main character. The story when you get down to it is pretty basic, where essentially it occurs many years in the future after some sort of apocalyptic event, and now time and the laws of the universe are running thin, with humanity on its last legs consequentially. The main character is the last gunslinger, which is this worlds version of a noble/knight, but his world was apparently ruined by a man dressed in black, and he's been chasing him for years. When the book starts, the Gunslinger is finally closing in on the man dressed in black, and he's only a desert away from finding the answers he's been searching for. I wouldn't wholeheartedly recommend this book, but it is definitely an interesting read. I'm not sure if I'll continue the series, but I am happy to have read it, I was always curious about the series as so many people love it, but perhaps it just isn't for me.
A must for King fans! This has been on my to read pile for ever, and I finally ended up listening to it on CD during my commute to fit it in. I'm actually glad I listened to it instead of reading it, because some of the scenes and descriptions were a bit out there. Listening to it helped me get a better visual of the world created by King. As someone who has read a LOT of King's books (most recently Black House) it was fascinating to see how The Gunslinger (one of King's earlier works) is referenced in his other works. The story and characters aren't as fleshed out as a typical King work (which tend to be excessively long), but the story never gets lost in the brevity.
Strange but interesting This was an interesting, if weird, book. It introduces the main character and sets the storyline for the other books in this series. Unfortunately, although the second and third books were good, the series generally fell flat. The ending was disappointing. I waited years for all the books to be written, so I could read them sequentially. What a shame it wasn't worth the wait.
A difficult but great beginning of a major masterpiece "The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed..." These are the magic words which open "Dark Tower" series, one of the major cycles in the history of fantasy litterature. As we now all know, this first installment was written by a very young Stephen King under the influence of the great western "The good, the bad and the ugly", with Roland being initially a copy of Clint Eastwood's character in Sergio Leone movie. In the first draft the desert chase was basically a retelling of Tuco's (Elli Wallach) pursuit of Eastwood's "man without name". Now, this is not a totally easy book - in fact, the first time I started it, I got tired in the middle and stopped... for 10 years! And when I tried again, I was hooked and enchanted. I read all the seven book cycle in the next months and count it as major event in my reading life. The enchantment of "Dark Tower" is due mainly to two things - a totally unique hero (Roland the last gunslinger) and an incredibly powerful decription of a world with which something is going really, but really wrong. The world of "Dark Tower" is somehow decaying, falling in pieces, loosing its structure, mixing with other worlds - and it creates an absolutely unique setting. So beware - if you have some deadlines in your work, wait with reading this book, because you could meet the same fate as me and spend every evening and every free moment reading "Dark Tower". And if you are a Stephen King hater beware even more, because you could suddenly discover that you were hating a major modern writer. This is indeed a very magical and for that reason a very dangerous book! One of the best things in "Dark Tower" series is that as the Tower is the axe around which evolves all the worlds in the Universe, all Stephen King books are connected to this cycle. There are openings to the Dark Tower in almost all his novels and in the Dark Tower series are the entries to all his books. This is quite an achievement. And all of this begins with the man in black fleeing across the desert and the gunslinger following...
Why I read so much. This is by far my favorite book. Not only is it my favorite book but it is soley responsible for why I read so much. I grew up on "Star Wars" for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I came to the conclusion that film was the best option for telling grand stories. I WAS WRONG. I started reading King from a young age but never started to read the Dark Tower series because they just weren't the kind of stuff I was accustomed to reading. That and they looked like a western. what's up with that? Then came the time that King started to write them again, and gosh darn it he was going to finish it. The man talked like a fan. He talked like somebody that was truly passionate about what he was doing. I listened when my favorite author told me "it is his masterpiece". So I went and got the first book in his saga "the gunslinger" only to find out he wasn't lying about "it being what he wants to be remembered for". I won't bore you by explaining the plot because trying to explain it to someone who has never read it is impossible. Just Know that "The Gunslinger" is biblical in the way that it is told. Think half "Lord of The Rings", half "The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly", all like nothing you've ever Read.
Best Series Ever! The Dark Tower is my favorite series of books ever written. The Gunslinger was written while King was still in college, so his writing isn't as developed at this stage, and the entire book is a bit slow and not so adventurous. However, it isn't BAD, and once you're through with this volume (you can call it the first part of a two part prologue, "The Drawing of the Three" being the second) you're in for 3000+ pages of pure epicness!
The Beginning of King's Crowning Achievement (*spoilers included*) The Gunslinger. This is where it all started for Dark Tower fans, this puzzling little novel that seemed to be such a departure from the expectations Stephen King had created with his first several books. I've heard many readers claim that they have trouble getting into The Gunslinger, calling it slow and recommending that people start with the second book, The Drawing of the Three. While I love the second DT book, I can't agree with the idea that this one is anything less than incredible. I was instantly pulled in by the premise of a hardened, unnamed gunslinger tracking a sinister, unnamed sorcerer across a fantastic alien landscape, seeking answers for his greater quest of reaching an unexplained colossus called the Dark Tower. The intrigue inspired by this setup was more than satisfied as I read about the wonders of Mid-World, one of Stephen King's most amazing creations as a writer. The gunslinger, eventually named as Roland well into the book, and his mythical past in Gilead, the provocative connections between Roland's world and ours, the terrifying creatures like the slow mutants, Roland's brute force and intensity...some of the myriad reasons I've been a dedicated Tower fan since reading the first page of this book. In the thrilling climax to the story, Roland catches his Man in Black, and this is where King really hooked me into the entire series. The sorcerer, Walter, sends Roland a vision where he comes to understand the true nature of infinity. He is shown that an endless array of worlds exist, side by side, within one another, or one on top of another, all held in place by the Dark Tower. Walter explains that a room exists at the top, and inside the room....? God? Nothing? That's the mystery, and Roland must solve it in order to save his world, and all the others that would fall should the Tower come to harm. In The Gunslinger, Roland encounters one challenge after another, keeping a stoic, Clint Eastwood `Man with No Name' persona throughout each successful battle. Stephen King allows his imagination to truly run free in this opening installment of the Dark Tower series, as well as the rest of what is the master work of his career. If you're a fan of King who has put off reading these books for whatever reasons, you've been missing out on some spectacular fiction that spans nearly all genres. It's a great series, and this is a great book to get it started. Having said all that, I have to warn potential newcomers that this particular version of The Gunslinger is a revised and expanded edition. After King finished the series, he decided that he wanted the first book to sound more like the others, so he went through page by page and altered some dialogue, added in several scenes, and made changes to certain aspects of Roland's character, as well as how some of the action transpires. I don't love the idea of King going back after the fact and changing the first book already knowing what he's done with the rest of it, making it look like some plot points were carefully planned from the start when not all of them were. It's not enough to ruin the book, but it is enough to drop it from five stars to four. It doesn't have quite the same tone of the original, which was part of its allure. I do recommend reading both versions just to have the full picture of what King wants the story to be, but of the two, I strongly prefer the grit and authenticity of the original.
The Beginning of King's Crowning Achievement (*spoilers included*) The Gunslinger. This is where it all started for Dark Tower fans, this puzzling little novel that seemed to be such a departure from the expectations Stephen King had created with his first several books. I've heard many readers claim that they have trouble getting into The Gunslinger, calling it slow and recommending that people start with the second book, The Drawing of the Three. While I love the second DT book, I can't agree with the idea that this one is anything less than incredible. I was instantly pulled in by the premise of a hardened, unnamed gunslinger tracking a sinister, unnamed sorcerer across a fantastic alien landscape, seeking answers for his greater quest of reaching an unexplained colossus called the Dark Tower. The intrigue inspired by this setup was more than satisfied as I read about the wonders of Mid-World, one of Stephen King's most amazing creations as a writer. The gunslinger, eventually named as Roland well into the book, and his mythical past in Gilead, the provocative connections between Roland's world and ours, the terrifying creatures like the slow mutants, Roland's brute force and intensity...some of the myriad reasons I've been a dedicated Tower fan since reading the first page of this book. In the thrilling climax to the story, Roland catches his Man in Black, and this is where King really hooked me into the entire series. The sorcerer, Walter, sends Roland a vision where he comes to understand the true nature of infinity. He is shown that an endless array of worlds exist, side by side, within one another, or one on top of another, all held in place by the Dark Tower. Walter explains that a room exists at the top, and inside the room....? God? Nothing? That's the mystery, and Roland must solve it in order to save his world, and all the others that would fall should the Tower come to harm.

THE GUNSLINGER by Stephen King The Gunslinger, by Stephen King, is the first novel in the Dark Tower fantasy series. It was originally published in five sections in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction from 1978 to 1981. King later revised The Gunslinger to remove contradictions with following books. This novel, a fantasy western, follows the gunslinger Roland in his quest of the man in black, with numerous flashbacks to Roland's past that give the reader information about his past, if not too much insight to his character (which comes primarily via his actions). The Gunslinger is highly stylized. It is filled to the brim with imagery, almost to the point of distraction for the reader. This gives the book a slower, deliberate pace and makes it reminiscent of a Sergio Leone/Clint Eastwood movie (which King acknowledges in his revised edition). All told, this is a fairly unique offering from the very versatile King, and is even stylistically unique among the books in this series. The original novel is more or less complete in itself; there is no cliffhanger ending. The book is entertaining in and of itself, and works both as a stand-alone novel and as the introduction to the Dark Tower series.
The Gunslinger owns! This is without a doubt the best book I've ever read. It is written in such a poetic, discriptive form that it is hard to put down. A very original idea and plot, this is a must read.
The Beginnings of an Epic "The Gunslinger" (being the first book in The Dark Tower sequence) is the first book by Stephen King that I ever read. While some of the language was poetic and used countless similes and metaphors, I found myself immediately sucked into the world of Roland. In other works that try to imitate King's descriptive style, the description takes over the story, this story is strong enough to live on it's own. As a matter of fact, this story is so strong that it breaks almost every convention and still survives. Most readers are happy to dive into a story where the plot, characters, and back story is introduced right away. In this book, that is not the case. The plot, the motivations, and the back story are revealed in the latter parts of the novel, but only to a point. The reader is thrown into a narrative, asking "Wait, but why--" as they go along. Only every now and then do they get answers, but this does not hinder the story-- it increases the excitement. This story has so much of the unknown that it becomes an escape, a mysterious world where everything is new to you. Roland's relationships, especially with Jake and the Man in Black, are not over done. There is no pure hate, and no pure love, as there is also no pure good or bad. Because who is to say that Roland is a "good guy"? This story throws a lot of questions up in the air, and leaves a lot of story to the later volumes. Despite this, it stands on its own as a complete and very readable novel. 9/10
Let King take you into Roland's world. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, even though I think that The Gunslinger is really an aquired taste. I never had the time to read through all of one of Kings works, and From a Buick 8 lost me in the first couple chapters. I decided to give this one a try since it was shorter and looked more appealing. After reading it through I was very impressed with it. I must say its very outlandish, but at the same time it doesn't lose me. The whole concept and story of Roland the Gunslinger and his quest for the Dark Tower is so deep and well thought out that you want to follow him on his journey, which perhaps was King's intentions. This first installment of the series does an excellent job with character development, and if you read through the first book you will realize why this is important. Roland becomes very real, you almost become intune with his feelings and emotions. By the time you read through to the Dark Tower, it will break your heart to see Roland go. I have not read much of King's work but i have to believe that the Dark Tower series is his most creative and inspiring work. Give the Gunslinger a try and let King take you into Roland's world.
The Man in Black fled across the desert.... And the Gunslinger followed. Thus begins the greatest collection of books ever written. (At least in my humble opinion) Mr. King weaves a tale of knights, adventure, and romance stretching across the centuries, as Roland of Gilead begins his pursuit of the evasive Man in Black. The first book in the Dark Tower saga, The Gunslinger, is a modest opening stanza in a tale where the following books were much better. It is the tale of Roland, the last Gunslinger, a kind of Knight/Cowboy who is chasing the Man in Black. This however is just a means to an end, as his ultimate chase is for The Dark Tower. Along his trek through the desert, he comes across a boy names Jake Chambers, who died in another reality. Eventually, Roland catches the Man in Black, sans Jake, whom he has sacrificed to reach said Man in Black. The Man in Black tells of Rolands future with a deck of tarot cards. Three cards are drawn to Roland attention: The Prisoner, The Lady of Shadows, and Death. ("but not for you Gunslinger.") Roland is left sitting on the edge of the Western Sea, pondering the future. Be careful if reading the original version of this book however, as the dialogue is dated and does not really match that of the later novels. I recommend the revised version, although I really enjoyed the original. The above is a general overview of the first book, and really should be read by any fan of either Stephen King, or any fan of the fantasy genre.
the best of the series While i love this entire series and consider it one of my favorites, this is probably the best of the bunch. Here, at the beginning of his career, King created the centerpiece of his future works. Nearly all of King's books fit into the general framework of the Dark Tower and a few are directly related. It is telling that King works to include stealthy references to the series in many of his books. But why is this the best of the series? It's hard for me to express. The writing conveys such an environment of grit, suffering, and entrapment for the ultimate anti-hero, Roland Deschain the last gunslinger, to fulfill his ultimate purpose within. The greatest success of this work lies in its genesis of this character. It is only because of King's surprising success at creating the dramatic and complex persona of his morally questionable protagainist that the, at first,apparently unwieldy and daunting task of writing such an expansive series was permitted to reach its final completion. This book, and the series as a whole,is a great attempt at recreating the epic nature of life's journey towards destiny, purpose, and finally, its end.
Fascinating Fascinating, intriguing book. Writen so well, building up a convincing fantastic new world. Implented in my mind great peculiar images. Kept me in a mysterious curious mood. It is a fine literature and a thriller.
The beginning of one of my favorite Stephen King series The beginning of one of my favorite Stephen King series. I have decided to go back and read it again in anticipation of The Dark Tower movie. I am about halfway through The Gunslinger and it it just as good as I remember it!
The Gunslinger The gunslinger Roland the character in the story where did he originate? Was he born or just became him, I don't know I'm just fascinated by the books. The dark tower I just kept reading until I got to the third novel.
King starting off slow I had many people asking me what I was reading while going through this series. It might have been because my hands were black from the ink off of the cover (I had taken the dust jacket off so that it wouldn't get folded up or ripped and the cover stained my hands black every time I read). Once I told them it was Stephen King they usually showed a disgusted look and told me that they didn't like Stephen King. I understand that horror is not their favorite genre, but King is an amazing storyteller. He has many books that break from his usual blood and gore. This series is more a fantasy that has been years in the making. I also recommend "The Long Walk" and "Different Seasons." Had I not devoted myself to finishing the whole of the Dart Tower series I probably would have stopped after this book. Sometimes slow, sometimes boring, this book seems to spark little of my interest in following through. It wasn't until the last few pages of book 7 that I actually found much of interest in the first book. Yet, it is a short book and as many books take time to build to an interesting conflict so does The Gunslinger.
Great series, only gets better. This is a great book, I would have given it five stars, but that takes away from the rating of the subsequent books in the series. The pacing is a little slower than The Drawing of the Three especially but altogether it's a good start to an awesome story so far (I'm only just finishing the fourth book).
Tight and enticing I loved this short book. It really fired me up to read the rest of the series. It's deceptively simple but the image or the man in black being pursued by the gunslinger is a potent one. It works! The rest of the Dark Tower series follow on of course and are, collectively, one of King's finest achievements.
Great Beginning to a Great Story!! This book was an excellent read!! I could not put it down. I just ordered "the coming of the three". Read Gunslinger, you will love it. King is at his best!!
A glimpse at great things This book showed that King already had been a wonderful storyteller but at the time of writing not up to his current level and finesse. As stated in his recently added foreword, the reader needs to trudge through overuse of adverbs and stylistic constructs. However, none of this really matters, as the characters are fleshed out with King's typical attention to detail and warmth. It's a great story, and the writing improves in later books.
A Great Introduction There's plenty that's been said about Stephen King's THE DARK TOWER series, but before all of that began, there was THE GUNSLINGER. This first novel is by far the shortest and simplest of a series that has become notorious for its length and convolution. This book, however, is a fantastic gateway to THE DARK TOWER's universe. For those who are not sure if they would like the series, THE GUNSLINGER is relatively short and a good indicator of what's to come in the series; the reader doesn't have to worry about plodding through a 1000 page novel of a series they may not even like. Additionally, the book is short and sweet -- it leaves the reader desperately wanting more. THE GUNSLINGER is a Western/Fantasy that follows the eponymous character as he chases a mysterious man across a never ending desert. There's a lot going on here: gunslinging (as the title would suggest), alternate dimensions, magic (with a k!), dying universes, and forgotten kingdoms. Luckily, the whirlwind of ideas here serve to be interesting and not intimidating. The book is bookended with commentary by Stephen King which serves as fascinating look at his reflections 20+ years after publication. You might be surprised by how critical he is with THE GUNSLINGER. This book doesn't even come close to cracking Stephen King's top 10 novels (maybe not even his top 20), but it does serve as a fantastic introduction to a series that contains some incredible fiction. I would recommend this to fans of King, but also of George R.R. Martin, Orson Scott Card, and H.P. Lovecraft -- there's a lot to like here.
King's epic hero I've only read the first three of this series, because there was a huge gap between release dates that had me forgetting what the heck happened and left me wary of picking up book 4 until I'd refreshed my memory. This is the tale of the Gunslinger and various associated characters who inhabit alternate worlds. This beginning of the series only vaguely clues you in on how BIG this is going to get . . . but you can really feel it building. King is a master at story-building, and this series is one of the triumphs of his career.
A great read that will leave you hungry for more It is a book that will leave you with many questions and a love for the main character. The passion he has for his quest is inspiring. It is a short novel that can quickly draw you in. A bit hard to follow at first but once you are immersed in his world it becomes an addiction and you feel you must read the next page. Stephan King, (A personal hero of mine) does a wonderful job at setting this new world for you as you follow Roland on his quest.
Super-spiritual sci-fi speculations, nice start As the first book in a series, it's expected, as short as it is, to just be the introductory book for the main character, in this case, the mysterious anti-hero, Roland. And what a strange character he is. We meet him when he gets to a ramshackle of a rundown place run by a small down-timer by the name of Brown (no relation to yours truly, obviously), who listens to his story of how he came to this point in time to this very place, or rather, the town where he came from. Not his birthtown, just his last resting place. And the tragedy that played out there. In that story we learn of his unique ability with guns... and eventually, how his ability can be a curse, not only a cure. From that story, we also meet a young boy, Jake, who has memories of a mythical place without a name (though it's obvious where), and a time that, according to Roland, is nothing but myth. And on to the journey to catch up to the mysterious man in black. I saw it interesting as to how there were two main villains in the story, the first being in Roland's first story, Sylvia Pittston, a hyper-religious woman, described as HUGE... yet lustfully voluptuous, who can command an entire town as the town's only preacher (and if you know the Bible well enough, you can tell she twists one of the story's play-out incorrectly, making her a false preacher that can command masses to do tragic things). Who's also with child, good thing it's not Roland's. The other, the man in black, always seems to be a step or a mile haed of Roland... then Roland and Jake. Until the right time, that being HIS right time. Then you read something scientifically valid as well as Biblically sound- about how there are mysteries to this universe that no one can truly understand, no matter how much they study it. And then, in the end, a strange little twist that will continue into the next story. So, what flaws were there to earn the 3/5? First, some of the descriptions were rather rough reading, so I felt that I had to force myself to read all the way through them, then that struggle ended when I got to the last chapter (there's only six). The other flaw being the typos. If there's just a few of them, it doesn't really bother me. But if there's quite a load of them or if they actually interfere with the storytelling, then it agitates me. In this case, there loads f typos (stopped trying to count when I got to ten barefly after the first half), and a couple of them did end up interfering with the story, which never fails to get me undone. Nevertheless, great story with an interesting metaphorical AND metaphysical concept, genre-bending/blending, and unique and unusual characters. Some much more memorable than others.
Talk about a cliffhanger! The dark tower series is a series of cliffhangers. With no real direction and a scanty outline Stephen can not paint himself into a corner. As with any dream (nightmare) you just change the rules if you get stuck with some logic. And this is what it is, just one long dream. It has all the elements of Stephen King including his potty mouth. Do not try to compare this loosely jointed series of encounters with works such as of J.R.R. Tolkien, Robert Jordan, and George Lucas, as they have no resemblance to the Joseph Campbell myth of someone challenged to become more than they are. This animal is in its own purely fantasy (don't look for depth) project. I say project because it is ongoing with out a clear stopping point in mind. If you look at it this way then it can be a "five star" in its category. "The Gunslinger" is over before it gets started no time to form an opinion. "The Drawing of the Three" twice as long as the previous, leaves you with a dislike for lobster. "The Waste Lands" twice as long as the previous, leave you with a dislike for Amtrak. By now you have no opinion, dislike eating lobster on Amtrak, and can not wait for the next installment (Wizard and glass.)
I enjoyed the first book of this series I enjoyed the first book of this series. It sort of dragged sometimes but it also brought up questions I hope are answered in later books. Like who is so and so and why is he doing that. I guess foundations are boring to look at but are necessary for a great structure. I recommend this book.
Must have! I have read the entire set and repurchased the first three as a gift for my son. I think I'll borrow them back whe he's done and reread them! They came quickly, and packaged so that I could wrap them up and put them underneath the tree in plenty o f time for Christmas.
Not the Best of the Series, but Still Magnificent With "The Gunslinger," Stephen King set out on one of the greatest epic journeys of modern literature. Each subsequent novel in The Dark Tower series picks up right where the last one left off, meaning that The Dark Tower is not really a series at all, but one monstrous novel. Upon its completion, with the publication of DT7 in 2004, I think King will have engineered one of the greatest achievements of our time. "The Gunslinger," even in its new, revised form, is the weakest book in the series if you're talking about the style and diction. But keep in mind, he wrote most of the novel when he was 19. Could you have written this well as a teenager? I couldn't have. And the plot of the novel more than makes up for the style. If you are not intrigued by Roland, the last gunslinger of Gilead, you are one seriously unimaginative person. In any case, if you are a little put off by the rough style of this novel, keep on reading. Each book in the series gets better than the one before it, and the excitement and suspense builds as Roland his band of pilgrims draw ever closer to the Tower. Hamlet, Jay Gatsby, Holden Caulfield, Atticus Finch, Aragorn, Hannibal Lecter. They are among the greatest characters in literature, and someday Roland Deschain will rightfully hold a place among them.
That's It...I'm Trapped! (Confessions of a New DT Junkie) I found a copy of this book at a local thrift shop. I plopped down my thirty-seven cents, opened it to the first page and damnit if King didn't get me! Now here I am, I have all seven books (I even have the Donald Grant Artist editions of the last three books) and I'm hopelessly addicted to Roland Deschain and the wonders of Mid-World. I have to new edition of the Gunslinger and I do intend of reading it some day (but not until I finish all seven) and I do think that the first version definitely had some slow parts to it. But when King gets to the action, strap yourself in and hold on tight! Originally, I thought the idea of a pseudo-western set on another world ludicrous. But once again, I underestimated King's skills as a storyteller and writer. I will not make the same mistake again. His imagination propels Roland on his mysterious quest. If you've read the Gunslinger, then you already know. But if you haven't embarked on the journey, I strongly urge you do so. I'm sure you won't regret it.
Page Turner Though being vague at points(like most fantasy novels begin, not having any real background story), this novel definitely keeps you turning the pages, hoping for answers. The novel is well paced, and has many emotional moments within. Highly recommended.
WOW - IF YOU READ TO ESCAPE THEN THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU This is by far one of the best books that i have ever read. I am a big King fan, yet you don't have to be a King fan to appreciate this novel. It is quite different from most of his others. What is very intriguing about this book is that one is not sure where it is set. It is set in a time when the world has moved on which would lead one to believe that it is futuristic, however at the same time the setting could be considered both medieval and western. In this novel we get our 1st glimpse of Roland one of King's most notorious characters. Roland is in search of the Dark Tower which is basically the center of all worlds. Due to his search Roland has hardened, he has made many sacrifices for the tower. The tower and his guns being perhaps the only thing that Roland loves. Everyone that i have ever recommended this book to has loved it and i am sure that you will too. King will not be remembered as a great writer, but he will be remembered as one of the best storytellers of alltime. Read this book, it is a must.
One of the best books ever One of the best books of all time. This whole series is still at the top of my favorites and is right up there with the Game of Thrones, Discovery of Witches, Shannara, Mayfair Witches and Outlander series. I have a lot of books I love because I read a lot (probably somewhere close to 100+ books a year since about I was 13, which is when I first picked up this book). So I have read close to 20,000 books and Roland the gunslinger still feels like an old friend. This is a must read for any book lover and especially epic fantasy lovers.
Even Better the Second Time King is truly a brilliant author. This is my second trip to the Dark Tower, and I now see much of the hidden meaning and symbolism King has left for us to unfold. This series keeps the reader enthralled until the very end.
Impressive way to start a series. After considering reading the series for years I finally gave in. This book seemed focused on setting up the series and plot twists to come. Because of this it wasn't the most exciting of King's books. With that said, it does an excellent job of opening many doors and making you consider the epic (literally) possibilities of what may come. I look forward reading the rest of the series, and for now I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a unique and interesting new story.
A new twist to Stephen King. The Gunslinger is different from many of King's other works, but at the same time, it encompasses everything else he has written. It is best described as a western with a sci-fi twist. Roland is certainly one of the most complex characters King has written and he has many facets that are not discovered until later books in the series. Once you have read all 4 of the books in this series, you will find yourself re-reading other books just to pick up on the connection to the Dark Tower series. Insomnia, Hearts in Atlantis, The Talisman, The Black House, Salem's Lot, and The Eye of the Dragon as well as The Stand are all directly connected to the Dark Tower series in quite obvious ways, but everything else King has written is encompassed in the world we come to know in the series. If you don't read anything else written by King, you should read this series. It doesn't contain the horror so obvious in most of his other works, but you won't be sorry to have spent time on these books.
A Great Work And Introduction Into the DT Realm... This book is often underrated as the bad egg of the Dark Tower series, but it is probably the best introduction one can imagine into a world so unlike (and at the same time eerily similar) our own. It is very apparent in this book that Stephen King had no idea what would become of the series, especially after you've read the later DT books, but it is still masterful. The storyline is straightforward and the characters are defined. Even Sheb, the pianist who briefly comes into the story, is memorable. The whole book has an underlying sense of this: The Gunslinger good, Man In Black bad. Don't mistake it as simple, however, as it is not. The Gunslinger may be good, but he is not perfect. He betrays his young friend, Jake, and allows him to fall to his death. Jake's last words "Go then, there are other worlds than these." still remain rooted in me as memorable. This book is truly a masterpiece. Read it, then the rest of the series.
The Gunslinger Stephen King is a divine author. The weaver of your most horrifying nightmares, turning them into novels that make your very eyes bleed. The Gunslinger, along with Stephen King's IT, were,in my opinion, his best and most intriguing novels he has ever written. The Gunslinger forms its amazingly twisted plot around Gilead, the last Gunslinger. This Man has amazing skills with his dual revolvers, so much skill that an entire village lies at his feet within seconds. Gilead is in pursuit of the Man in Black, a mysterious figure that lurks in the area. Gilead, on his way, finds a young woman named Alice, and a young New Yorker boy named Jake, to whom he develops a stangely fond attachment to. This novel is read in the third person, with some flashbacks and poetic moments. It is a very mature read, involving strong violence, some language and brief adult content. The book itself is a great, exciting novel that will provide hours and hours of haunt and action. I highly reccomend it.
Beautifuly sad I loved this book. I originaly started with the fourth volume of this series (it was a gift from my dad, and he hadn't noticed that it was a series until I told him...) and I instantly fell in love with Roland's dying world. Since I couldn't understand much of the story, I decided to start it from the begining. I wanted to know more about Roland of Gilead and his group of companions... I found the first novel a bit dry at the begining (very understandable), but it got easier to read once I got started. I litteraly devoured it (I usualy don't read fast) and finished it within a week, which is a record for me. I just love the way King describes this cruel, dying and magical world in such a crude and beautiful way. I didn't learn much about the gunsligner's quest, but I SO wanted to read the other two books, and definitely re-read the fourth. I recommend this book, and this series, to anyone who isn't scared of falling in love with loneliness, fear, death, and their beauty.
The world has moved on Stephen King's "The Gunslinger." How the world must move on in order to survive Stephen King's "The Gunslinger" is set in a world that is virtually a broken mirror reflection of our own. Here, the last of the world's great heroes, Roland of Gilead, chases his biggest villain, Marten Broadcloak through the desert that seemed endless. This world is littered with shadows of a world that used to be, machines of an age even before Roland's own birth that no one no longer knows how to use. So, Roland chases his nemesis through this world that is falling apart, piece by piece. He stops occasionally, interacting with locals and refilling his supplies, but the intense drive to catch this criminal always remains intact, at the forefront of his mind. He is a single minded machine of his upbringing, killing when necessary and deadly when called to arms. Roland of Gilead provides the reader a hero to side with, though later in the story his worthiness of being the good guy comes into question quite sharply. As Roland moves through this world, he notes the significant changes around him, how even the earth itself seemed to be dying. Crops no longer grew, people no longer procreated and raised healthy young children, and the animals seemed to just be hanging on by a whisper. His own mule died while he was dining with a desert hermit and the man's crow ate the eyes from the dead mule. Death seemed to be the only release from the torment of a dying world. He meets a young boy that died in his own world only to awaken in Roland's, only to sacrifice this young son for the chance to achieve his ultimate passion, to reach the Dark Tower and perhaps, save the world from dying completely. The story shows many religious and political implications, from the man in black crossing the desert running from the last gunslinger, to the sacrifice of the "Son" for the greater good by Roland himself. This story was written in King's youth, just after a time of social upheaval and change within the United States. The world lost a great man, people gained equality unknown previously, and society seemed on the edge of an ultimate show down between the world's nuclear powers. The main message that started this saga was that the world could no longer go on as it always had, ignoring the needs of the needy, suppressing the people not in agreement with the social norm, and blatantly segregating segments of the population because of race, color, or national origin. The world must "move on" in order to achieve the ultimate goal for equality and fair treatment for all. If it did not "move on" the world was surely on the path of destruction, as it was pictured in the post-Apocalyptic world in which Roland traveled. President John F. Kennedy, in my opinion, was the inspiration for the Roland, combined with the ideal movie "gunslinger" like Clint Eastwood portrayed for many years. (See the movie "Hang'em High" for an example.) His valiant struggle for equality for all Americans, combined with his steely handling of the world wide issues from Cuba to Russia gave him the title according to Time's Magazine as "The world's last gunslinger."

This is one of the best series i have ever read This is one of the best series i have ever read. I love these books. Wizard and Glass is one of the best books Stephen King has ever written. you can not go wrong with this one. some say they get bored with the first book and don't finish. Please get to the second book and you simply will not turn back. The first is more of a western, but by the end it all makes sense, sort of. Highly Recommend!!
King's best This collection of four related stories of Roland of Gilead was originally sketched out by King long before he achieved fame, notoriety, and wealth, as the start of a mammoth opus that is nowhere near completion. Its grandiose vision, combined with its modest initial scope, betrays the vaulting youthful ambition of the author, yet these four small stories stand out from the rest of King's work for their haunting and poetic character. The combination of vision and craftsmanship in these tales is unequalled in any of King's later work. The three (so far) sequels to The Gunslinger attempt to flesh out King's vast vision, leading to literary bloat. Sometimes what is indicated but left unsaid is far more powerful than what is fully explained. The whole story will be worth reading if you have a few months to give to it, but The Gunslinger will only take a couple of hours and will reward you with one of the few true masterpieces of postmodern imaginative fiction.
The beginning of the best saga in years The Gunslinger is the first book of a saga you'll enjoy until the end. Roland, the last gunslinger in that world, tries to catch the Man in Black, a figure we won't learn about it until the end. During his travel in the desert, he finds Jake, a boy that dies in our world and is pulled strangely into Roland's. The circumstances of Jake's death and why he is part of Roland's "ka" aren't very clear in this first book. With the reading of the Man in Black's Tarot cards, we learn briefly and a little confusing about Roland's future in his quest for a Dark Tower. About the Tower we get little, if almost no information in this first book about what it is and why Roland wants to find it. The Dark Tower I: The Gunslinger, is a complete novel in itself, it doesn't have events unatended, even though, the situation is just beginning, and the reading of the next books of the saga is a must for those that enjoy this first book.

The Gunslinger I have not read any of the other books in the series but after reading this first volume, I hunger for more. The story's beginning drags on at an almost agonizing pace, testing the reader and revealing few clues concerning the import of Roland's quest. His meeting with the dweller and foray into Tull cement mid-world's morbid atmosphere and Roland's grit but leave the reader grasping for context. Yet, as the narrative and Roland's backstory unfolds I was drawn into the mythology. I agree with other reviewers that Jake was a flat character and indeed his last lines belie a complexity he had previously failed to embody. But for their patience, readers are rewarded with a satisfying dialogue between the gunslinger and the man in black with the tease of even greater truths to come (for who knows how many lies MIB had woven with truth). My favorite reviews reveal little but give a taste of what the reader should expect. My advice, read on.
The beginning to one of the best series I've ever read The beginning to one of the best series I've ever read. Written across most of King's career, the story evolves along with the reader and society. As society has changed, the characters and settings in the series change. If you are a fan of King, you HAVE to read this. Even if you are not, but you enjoy a well told story with twists, triumph, heart-wrenching tragedy, and a page-turning plot, don't miss it.
"The Gunslinger" makes you want to read more. Eerie, imaginative, and vivid all describe "The Gunslinger and the Dark Tower". This book is the first part of the "Dark Tower" series of books by Stephen King. This book is about the gunslinger, whose real name is Roland, and his quest across a desolate land. This land is a twisted mirror or our own. He walks through the desert in the pursuit of answers to many questions he has. These answers are held by the man in black. In his pursuit he has a romance with a woman named Alice, who lives in Tull, a town in the middle of the desert. He also adopts Jake, a boy from Earth, as his son. This book makes you want to read it until the end. Even in the end it leaves many questions unanswered. I actually want to read the next book in the series, which is the first time a book has made me want to read another book. This is why I believe this book is great, because it leaves you wanting more.
Best King ever It has been a very long time since I sat down with a Stephen King book. The last book of his that I had read where the Bachman Books which I thoroughly enjoyed. I was never a big fan of his wordy drawn out descriptions of objects, people and scenery. A friend of mine kept bugging me to read the Gunslinger. He said that it was nothing like any of Kings work I had ever read. He was right. This is definitely Kings masterpiece. From cover to cover you are emerged in the story. It took me 2 days to read the entire thing. Since then I have read the Drawing of the Three, which is a little slower than the Gunslinger but still great. Tonight I will begin my journey through the wastelands. If you are looking for a book to just casually read this is not for you. However if you are looking to start an adventure that you will never forget I suggest picking up this book. The man in black fled across the desert and I followed.
Gunslingers and Wizards I love spaghetti westerns and this is one of my favorite western stories. Technically I guess it's not a western though since the story is set in a different world. The story revolves around a Clint Eastwood like hero named Roland, with amazing gunfighting skills, on a quest through Midworld to find a man in black. In his search for the man in black, the gunslinger must face multiple foes like daemons, mutants, and some decisions that leave a haunting affect on the gunslinger. The Gunslinger is the first book in an 8 book series with a pretty unique story and multiple references to previous Stephen King books. This book was one of my favorites in the series, mostly because it had the most western-like story. I really enjoyed the whole series though, and Song of Susannah was the only one I didn't think was really that great. The series is a nice western-fantasy combination.
Excellent Read, but don't start here! When I first ventured in to the realm of Roland of Gilead, it was thanks to an audiobook I received from my cousin at Christmas time. When I learned the title, I can, without any shame, say that I was less than enthused. That book was, The Drawing of The Three, the second book in this amazing masterpiece of American literature. From just the "Argument" section of DOTD, I was hooked. Upon completing the book, I was desperate to know more about the mysterious Roland: where he came from, what made him so driven? I immediately procured "The Gunslinger" and must say I enjoyed it thoroughly. It does answer many questions, but in typical Stephen King fashion, leaves many more to be answered. I guess the point I'm trying to make is that I believe DOTD is the place to start. Begin there, get sucked in to this amazing world, then backtrack and read the Gunslinger. All hale the King!
It is disgusting! It has some weird brown stuff all over ... This review is not for the actual book but the product. It is disgusting! It has some weird brown stuff all over the cover with freaking feathers stuck to it! Not only that but the cover had been folded in half repeatedly and was about to fall apart. I got this book as a present and was entirely disappointed. And I understand that with a used book there is going to be some wear but is gross. Too cheap to send back so just going to grow away
It's the beginning of a fascinating tale. Stephen King embarks in a very long tale that only begins in this book and is supposed to take 5 or 6 other books to finish. Reading this book you have to understand that it is merely the beginning, and yet it is a very good book in itself. In "The Gunslinger" you enter the life of the last gunslinger in a world that has "moved on", in his quest for the "Dark Tower" which in my opinion symbolizes the domain of the universe, some form of heaven. In this first book the gunslinger follows the man in black, who is his enemy. It takes you a while to understand and identify yourself with the gunslinger's world, but when you do, you can't get enough of it. I recommend it if you are planning on reading the others that follow. I am currently reading the third (The Waste Lands), and I have to say that you really get hooked when you are reading the second book
Storytelling at its best Oh my God, the storytelling is awesome!!!! The setting serves as a painting of conflict. The characters, good-bad-ugly-main-small, are distinctive and vivid. The tension in the chase holds throughout the whole novel so that each page demands to be turned and read.
Excellent I had read it when it first released but dropped the series after 4 because it was taking too long. Since it is now finished I thought I would give it a second whirl. Well worth it after one, now to the next.
One Of The Best Books I've Read In A While When I needed a book, to do for an English class, I turned to Stephen King. The cover and title intirgued me enough to pick it up, and needless to say, the book was awesome. What makes the book lose points is the ending and the time jumps. King tries to use the jumps between the main plot and Roland's childhood to try to explain the action, but i found the jumps were confusing and kinda pointless, but maybe im wrong. The ending although it ends the first book of the series is kinda weak in my eyes, but otherwise the book is a great read. The storng point of the book is that it always seems to pull your atention back into the plot, by illustrating Roland's confrontations and his need for his trusty Revolvers. Finally, I felt that this was a good opening book in a series becuase it leaves so many anwsers unanswered that your almost obligated to continue.
An excellent start to a good series Presently, I am half way through the Dark Tower series having just finished up Wizard and Glass. Out of the four books of the series I have read thus far, book one: The Gunslinger remains my favorite. Stephen King does a fine job in laying out the chase between the Gunslinger and the Man in Black. After reading the book I wanted to know much more about the Man in Black (and four books in I still don't know a whole lot), I was a fan of the Gunslinger (and remain so four books later), but I was confused by just what the purpose of the boy Jake was other than to create a sympathetic character (he turns out to be very important in the coming books). The book is a quick read, not overly complex but not simplistic either. A solid thumbs up book. By the end of it you will know whether or not you want to continue the series. I couldn't wait for the next book.
A good read I love this book it doesn't drag for me. At the same time it's not the best book I've ever read or the most well written, but it captivates me personally. You might find it harder for you to read but it is WORTH IT. the rest of the series is phenomenal so please whatever you do, do not stop here.
A Great Start The Gunslinger is an odd novel. It mixes a lot of genres, including: Western, Science fiction, Romance, Mystery and Suspence, and Adventure. If any other author attempted a book like this, it would probably be a dud. But Stephen King writes it perfectly. This story is told from the POV of Roland Deschain, a gunslinger from a long dead city known as Gilead. He is chasing The Man in Black. Along the way he meets Jake, a young teenager from our world. This story takes plce both in realtime and flashbacks. King makes you love both stories, where as in other stories you usally like just one. There are five parts to this story: The Gunslinger, The Way Station, The Orcale and the Mountains, The Slow Mutants, and The Gunslinger and The Man in Black. This was originally published in 5 parts over severel months. I loved the characters in this book, especially The Man in Black and Roland Deschain. I warn you: There is a sort of cliffhanger in this book so be readty and have the second book ready for reading.
Get into the series before you judge it.... This is a necessary introduction to the Dark Tower series, arguably Stephen King's greatest contribution to fantasy. It's not truly a stand alone book. Therefore, you're not going to have complete understanding of where this is going until you get there. Therefore, the best way to read it is to just experience it. Roland in this book is best pictured as a western gunslinger, but we do learn that isn't his origin. Nor do we know for sure exactly where all this is occuring. A significant scene has Roland asking Mr. Brown whether he believes in an afterlife, and Mr. Brown answers that he thinks this is it. This opening volume takes us with Roland in his pursuit of the Man In Black. Don't expect to find out just who this personage is. Just go with the trip and then grab the next volume. Trust me, you'll be glad you did.
King at his polished best I have always loved Stephen King's between-worlds books (The Talisman, Black House, Needful Things), but the Dark Tower series is Mister King at this best! Roland will have you rooting him on through each adventure, though he is written as a realistic hero with human flaws that can make you slightly disturbed by his decisions. The villians will have you cheering at their demise, or desiring their end when escaping due to their pure-evil outlook on life. The supporting cast of characters will have you wanting them to learn more from Roland, while retaining their own values as they become driven to reach the end of this adventure. Overall, an amazing series of books that may seem excessively long, but with so much content to share it is well worth the detailed descriptions provided by King to keep you visually on target where the story is going.
amazing The first volume of a 7 volume series in which we meet the man Roland, who is on a quest to find the ever elusive Dark Tower. In the first volume we get to know who Roland is and what he is about. We get to know what kind of person he is. We also meet Jake another character that plays a major part in this story to find the Dark Tower, although he doesn't play a major role until the second volume. In this volume you also get to meet the Man-in-Black, who the Gunslinger Roland is chasing. This book is a very imaginative and mystifying book. In which you get to know the characters in more of an intimate matter through their actions and thoughts than most other books of the genre, a definate plus. This volume of The Dark Tower series is an excellent starting point in the adventure of Roland and his companions to find the Dark Tower.
A bit weird at times The first time I read The Gunslinger I was 14 or 15 and I thought: what a weird book is this ?!? Granted, it's set in a weird world, but I think I was also a little too young to understand it all. I re-read it a number of times now and I really love it. The atmosphere is a bit different from the books that follow, because Roland is alone most of the time. And then there is that episode with Jack... It's a dark book on the whole, but, like I said, really good. So if you're looking for feel-good book, don't read this one. The Dark Tower series is an absolute masterpiece, which took Stephen King more than 20 years to finish. And you can't compare it to any of this other work. So if you're reluctant to start these books, because you're not a big thriller-Stepehen King fan: these books are nothing like the others he writes...
King when there are no limits on reality King is far more than a popular author. Someday we will concede, although his material is often disturbing, this author is a literary giant. This is the first volume in his fantasy opus, the Dark Tower series, which is worth the time. It is literature without much education, which is hard to do. But if readers like spell binding prose, much of which is artful, they will like this volume. Probably the best in the series.
King's best work The introduction into the odd world of the story's main character Roland is quite possibly King's finest work. Moving away from his norm of fright/horror, this book takes place in a world in which the world's last gunslinger travels across a rapidly dying world in search of The Dark Tower, a mysterious unexplained destination. However, in this world we see signs that it was at one time the same world as our own (or at least very similar). What makes this book the most interesting is not what it tells you, but what it doesn't tell you. It allows the reader to make their own theories as to what has happened to the world, what is happening, what will happen. The Gunslinger (and the books that follow it in the Dark Tower Series) is one of the best works from this modern writer and is definately worthy of your collection.
Enter a world like no other... I don't like Stephen King's novels. I find them dull, wordy and they are some of the only books I can't finish. Then I came across The Gunslinger. It is a book of magic, of another world, of pure and unadulteraded genius. This is the series Stephen King was born to write. From the first sentence you are drawn into the world of the Gunslinger. And you don't escape until you reach the end of the book. I couldn't put this book down and when I finished I read it all over again. I'm not going to go into a long description of the book, I wouldn't do it justice. You have to read this one for yourself. Enter the world of imagination, and from what I gather if you are a King fan, you may recognise some of the characters. The only critisism I have is when is the author going to give us the next book in the series?? I can't wait.
It took a while to get into, but becomes a great read I had heard great things about the "Dark Tower" series and finally decided to go ahead and give it a shot. This first book, "The Gunslinger" sets the tone rather well for the series, but is really unlike any other Stephen King book. It was a bit difficult to get "into" until after halfway through it (which didn't take long; it's a fairly short book). Once you get past the halfway mark, the story really gets going. Prior to that, all the "set-up" of following the Gunslinger on his quest to find the "Man in Black" is just...weird...for lack of a better description (even for the Stephen King world). The story is a good one, though. It's hard to describe without giving away some good tidbits of the Gunslinger's tale, but I recommend getting through this one. The others become REALLY engrossing from that point forward.
great story To say perhaps everything I need to say, I immediately want to read the next one. The gunslinger is a fascinating character through and through, and both he and the world King has placed him in is one I'm intrigued to see develop.
A bit disjointed, but ultimately a great book Admittedly, I felt lost on several occasions while reading this, the first book in the Dark Tower series. For me at least, that was most of the fun. Trying to figure out what this world of Roland Deshain's is, what happened that made it this way, and what the hell is the Dark Tower and this elusive Man in Black? There are some great moments in this story that shed some light on the proceedings, but just enough to wet your appetite. The last several pages alone were worth the read in my opinion. This novel/series may not be for everyone, and to those that have tried to get through this book and have stopped for one reason or another, the writing definitely takes a turn for the better in the subsequent books. Give the Dark Tower and The Gunslinger a try, you won't be disappointed, but if you are, then I apologize.
If it ain't broke, don't fix it... Most of the people on here read this book and assumed it was 'the first' Dark Tower book. However, this is a re-write of the original 'Gunslinger', expanded and adapted to accommodate the gargantuan bulk of the following novels in the series. The original Gunslinger was vastly different in terms of writing style, tone, and overall content. While basic elements remain the same, Stephen King has attempted to 'flesh out' this first installment in the series in order to help blend it with the rest. This is a shame, because the original book had a mystic, surreal tone to it and, as one review suggests, more of a concentration on the quest itself rather than the 'big fireworks ending' that the series itself eventually builds up to. Go buy the original Gunslinger, and read it for itself. Then, if you read the rest of the series, read this version of the Gunslinger after you finish The Dark Tower and decide you liked the stylistics of the post-Gunslinger Dark Tower stories.
How do I love thee? Let me count the ways... I read this book when it came out, so I had a long wait to see how Roland might end his saga. Actually back in that day I wasn't all that convinced that King would finish this series. Although my faith was tested it was all good in the end, as King did finish this series. And what an ending!! Most of the time, when I tell a friend that I just finished a 7-book series, most will roll their eyes and wonder if all that was worth it. In this case I say YES. Unlike other series, this first book is compelling but not the best by far. Just read it and get through it. It may not make any sense now but its going to in the later books. Look forward to book two which has some of the most clever monsters and ideas that I've read from Stephen King in a long time. Exceptional in every way, read this book.
AMAZING Book! Addicting Series! Readers BEWARE! Once you start this series, you are never going to want to stop. Stephen King leaves you questioning everything and makes you so stubborn that you will not stop reading until you find the answer. I have never been so wrapped up in a series before in my life. I recommend all to read and get ready for this AMAZING adventure.
Don't read this book and give up on the series! I read this after a friend read it and loved it. I read it and thought it was mediocre at best. However, I refused to give up on the series and possibly miss out on a great saga, and I am very glad I didn't. After I read part II: The Drawing of the Three, I came to appreciate this book for what it is; a prologue of sorts, much like "The Hobbit" in the LoTR Trilogy. This book introduces you to Roland, and starts his massive quest for the Dark Tower. Each book in the series leave enough questions to keep you reading the series and wanting to understand everything. As the saga progresses, everything starts to add up and connect. That said, judging the series on a single one of the books would be a crime. I loved this, though it isn't his usual captivating horror. A masterpiece.
I love what I have read of this series I love what I have read of this series. I have read the first four books and then got away from it for too long, so am reading it all again to refresh my memory. Wish the whole series was out then. I might have finished it all and not had to reread it. I was so captivated in it. Great story and great adventure
Just didn't like it! What does this weird story have to ... Just didn't like it! What does this weird story have to do with Gunslingers? Can't believe this series would be King's Magnum Opus . Just makes no sense whatever to me,. just too unbelievable. Brady Hartfield in 'End of Watch' is weird but more plausible and interesting. The Gunslinger is not a good name for this book...I don't know what is. The 'Man in Black' is not a serious character, as aren't the others on the way. Just my opinion. If it hadn't be a short read, I would have put it down!
Rather strange This is a rather strange book. It's somewhat confusing to begin with. The universe mirrors our own in many ways, but in others is so completely different. Little is explained this early on, so uncertainty and confusion are quite prominent. However, it is a very well written book, and has a good pace. It picks up toward the end, and it holds a wonderful and eerie dream-like quality, making the reading of it seem just as if you were asleep. The ending is better than the beginning, but i think that is probably only just because, as we get more familiar with the world and the characters, it becomes easier to fathom out. I am quite looking forward to the next novel in the series, if just to get a few explanations, and to see where he is taking Roland the Gunslinger next.
On The Road With The Gunslinger Stephen King is one of those authors I've loved since I was a young teen (I even visited his house during one summer vacation.) However, being a young teen with a short attention span - and King having the tendency to pen some rather thick tomes - I never finished any King novel I started. Pet Cemetery; Gerald's Game; It. I even wrote an 11 page book report on Cujo my freshman year... having not read the entire thing. So King and I go way back, sorta. We've shared some good, albeit truncated, times. Well, I have finally got around to finishing my first King novel; the trick was apparently that I needed an audio book. The Gunslinger introduces us to Roland Deschain, the titular Gunslinger, as he traverses a barren desert in search of Man in Black, a shrouded and intriguing antagonist with God-like abilities to possess the minds of people and even raise the dead. Along the way, Roland meets a young boy, Jake Chambers, whose strange past causes Roland to think heavily about the world he lives in, and whose companionship is just another woeful test set forth by the torturous Man in Black. The Gunslinger is a somewhat disjointed narrative - a Fear-and-Loathing-esque head-trip - one that jumps from present to flashback to alternated reality. But for me this form does a good job at putting us in Roland's own disoriented mind. King's description are spot on without being insensate wordy and his characterization is excellent. All in all I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed my trek through Mid-World, and narrator George Guidall was a fitting and entertaining companion. I look forward to continuing the journey.
All of my friends had strongly recommended it. Unfortunately I decided to read this as I ran out of all my other high fantasy series. All of my friends had strongly recommended it. Unfortunately, I just could not get into this book. It was a slog and I cannot stand Stephen King's writing. I am finishing up book 2 now and wondering how/if I am going to bother reading anymore of them.
Great Book This really was a great read. It was the first book I've read by King, and I was not disapointed. The Gunslinger is definetly the type of book that picks up as it goes along. While some sections in the beggining drag a little (hence my only giving it 4 Stars), once the book gets rolling it becomes a fun and exciting read. The charecters are great, and King's prose doesn't disapoint. Roland's journey through this distopian world is riveting. I think that the best compliment that I can give this book is that it made me (imediately) want to go out and get Book 2. The book ends not with an ending, but with a beggining, and I can think of few readers who would not be compelled to want to continue on in this great series.
First Book in the Dark Tower Series "The Gunslinger" was one of the first books I ever read by Stephen King (sometime in the early 90s), and even though it's not one of my favorites, it's still worth reading if you like King's fantasy novels. It takes place in another world where Roland, the gunslinger, pursues The Man in Black across dry, dangerous terrain, entering town after town and stumbling across various characters who will ultimately lead him to a mortal battle with The Man in Black. This series/book isn't like King's typical horror fare (i.e., "Cujo" or "Carrie"); it has more of a western/sci-fi feel to it. That's probably why I didn't like it as much. But if you're into this type of genre, then you'll more than likely enjoy the Dark Tower series--"The Gunslinger" (#1), "The Drawing of the Three" (#2), "The Waste Lands" (#3), and "Wizard and Glass" (#4).
I had hoped for more I found it slightly confusing. I have read many Stephen King novels and he ranks as one of my favourite authors. Not having read any of the Dark Tower series I decided to start. To be honest it did not do a lot for me but I will read the next in the series to see if perhaps you need to continue to really get a feel for the storyline.
Gunslinger Review SPOILERS: The Gunslinger tells the tale of a lone man travelling across a barren landscape, chasing a "man in black". The story does not offer any motivation or background for the journey; simply that the gunslinger has placed a duty upon himself. On his journey (initially through a desert, he spends a few days in a quiet town called Tull. In order to get out, he has to shoot and kill every single resident, because they go slightly crazy. Later on in the journey, he stumbles upon an abandoned boy and reluctantly takes him under his wing. Together they chase the man in black, and eventually see him in the mountains. They follow him down a dark tunnel, and after many days, reach the end. The boy falls to his death and the gunslinger talks with the man and black about the future and the nature of the universe. Overall, the plot was entertaining and exciting, albeit one-dimensional. Furthermore, due to the fact that it is the beginning of a seven-book series, many phenomena and issues raised in the book were not answered or addressed, which could make it difficult to read as a stand alone book. One theme present in the story was the theme of solitude. Roland, the main character, is continually referred to as "the last gunslinger", emphasizing his loneliness. Also, the book ends with the boy - whom Roland had started to grow close to - falling to his death, leaving the gunslinger alone once more. The themes in the book were very subtle, but they relayed a powerful message that was eerie and exciting at the same time.
Hooked I have found most of Stephen's books hard to get into, but once I do I am hooked. In this story Gunslinger Roland is searching for a mysterious Man in Black, who just might be able to help the Gunslinger find the Dark Tower. There are a lot of subtlety and vision into Roland's life that is intriguing, to say the least. Roland is a kind soul, but very capable of violence. There is a shootout in this story- that's not to say this is a western because it is far from it. But, who would have thought Hey Jude would be playing in a saloon. King is at his best at spinning yarns that stagger the imagination of the reader. He is truly a master when it comes to writing great tales. Hope you check out The Gunslinger.

Interesting for King Definitely an interesting piece by King. It's nice to see something outside of the horror genre that still holds glimpses into that horrific, twisted, wonderful mind of his :) I found the story a bit hard to follow at first and actually felt quite disoriented going into even the final quarter of the book. The imagery is amazing as always with King, but I found it hard to care about the characters in this book (which may be due to the main character's own detachment from them) but found at the end of this book that I definitely needed to follow the story line into the next book. I think if the ending hadn't been filled with so many questions that I may not have continued. Hopefully the following books will be of the 4 and 5 star variety.
The first step toward the tower This first book in the "Dark Tower" series is special. I believe it is the first book King ever wrote, (he wrote it in college on green paper) and this book is his finest work. As a reader, you are immediately taken in by Roland Deschain (the gunslinger) who is in search for the man in black. King's writing in this book is clean, straight forward, and to the point. I'm sure many King fans know how this author can get side-tracked into an abyss before returning to the true nature of the story. However, that is not the case in this book. The ending of this book introduces you to the philosophy of the series. In fact, the ending to this first book might be the most important aspect of the entire series. I'm sure that any reader will enjoy this book. It is a treat that will send you off on a quest for the tower. A quest that will end in the last book of the series.
The First in the Saga is a Worthy Introduction "The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed." Mention these words to a reader of King's Dark Tower saga and you will be able to see the effect that the Dark Tower has had on his or her life. The Gunslinger, the first in the series, pales in comparison to, but is a good indicator of, the quest a reader is embarking on when choosing to read the series. While most would agree that this is one of the weaker volumes in the series, it is a great start and sets up the story to come. Definitely read this book. If you like it, continue on, but if you don't like it, do not judge the entire series based on this one. At least read the next book to make your decision on whether or not to continue with the series.
Second Time was the Charm my 1st attempt at The Gunslinger was on audio-tape @ work. I promptly began to nod off before the 1st tape was finished. I swore off the book. months went by, and desparation for ANY listening material led me back. i don't proclaim to know what had changed for me, but suddenly I found myself trudging the desert with Roland, eager to see where each step would take us. the entire Dark Tower series is a part of my world. i re-read it as a whole about every 1 1/2 years (and a part of me still thinks that maybe he will catch the boy after all.....). I recommend that king fans (and any avid readers) who may have struggled getting into the story to be patient. Put it away for a few weeks or so & then try it again.
Breathtaking in its scope and chaotic diversity. Roland of Gilead, although for this brief moment in time, we only know him as Roland...THE LAST GUNSLINGER. A chilling, haunting, and far reaching work in its scope...THE GUNSLINGER is a closely structured look into the psyche of one man. Neither Good nor Evil, Roland simply is...and so is The Dark Tower that haunts his dreams, and his life...and has so for an untold time. The imagery is stark...much like the destination of todays society. And the Man In Black. He is the ghost we all chase...in hopes that he can reveal to us our destiny. Highly provokative and the perfect beginning for Roland to impart to us the tale of his quest...and his one true desire. To find this damned citadel of ebony...and to wage his final battle...
The Gunslinger I am a huge fan of Stephen King, having read most of his stand alone novels however I was a little hesitant to start this series mainly because of reviews I have heard saying that it was slow, boring, confusing and not what they expected a Stephen King novel to be. I admit I knew very little about what this series was actually about, apart from it having a 'western' flavour, a gunslinger seeking a mysterious Dark Tower. I decided to give it a shot after Wind Through the Keyhole came out to judge for myself and I have to say that I loved every second I was reading it! While this book barely explains anything about Roland or his quest for the Dark Tower, the world that King has given us a taste of makes me very excited to continue my journey.
An end to the beginning... It was just as I remember reading it 10 years ago. I can't recommend this book enough for those who are ready to start their adventure...but be warned. As with any adventure, you will love and lose. I remember my dad telling me he cried at certain parts, and I know I will again. I am off, to be with Roland, in his quest for the Dark Tower.
if you enjoyed Lord of the Rings I am still trying to find the fifth star for this book. It takes a bit of time to get into it because everything might have been clear in the author's mind, but on paper one struggle a bit to get to what the Dark Tower really is and when it all started. However, if you enjoyed Lord of the Rings, this is the "series" for you - THe Dark Tower series!
The Dark Tower, The Gunslinger One of my co-workers introduced me to this series and all I can say is WOW!. I was totally sucked into this story as soon as I started reading it. I've read the first four books in a month!. Cannot put it down!
Buy all 8 books in the series. And any new ones that become available! While this version is a little different than the original, it's Stephen King. What more needs to be said? Buy the series, pour your favorite beverage, get comfy, call in sick and enjoy reading this fantastic story for a few weeks.
Completly different and amazing. It's perfect. If you read it you will love it. It will make you wonder about all the possibilities that our universe has to offer. I only hope the ending will be worthy of the most incredible idea that Mr. King has offered us , so far. It is a story so immense that I hope he doesn"t finish it for another ten years. It will be worth it.I have read almost all of King's books. Although there not all equally good. They are all great stories. I hate it when people criticize him. Most of the time they are speaking from positions of ignorance any way. They are people who obviuosly are not very good at reading to begin with because they cannot grasp the ideas that he presents. Read the Dark Tower. It's an expience you won't forget.
Number one with a Bullet! First time I bought this book I was amazed, because this didn't look like ordinary King-stuff. I was astounded by the great illustrations, too. I had a few occations of trying to get into the whole story, but the more I tried, the more I liked it. It was different King, and then again it wasn't, and I liked it a lot. It's strange, mystic, gothic and scary at many times. The world of the Gunslinger and his hunt for the Man in Black really enchanted me, and I couldn't put the book down. As I realized that this was the first book in a serie, I couldn't wait to get my hands in the others. But this Dark Tower 1 was my number one with a bullet, especially in a time where I only thought that King wrote downright horror.
Confusing, not his best While reading this book I kept having to go back a few pages to an entire chapter to see if I missed something. The story jumps around in such a way that it is difficult and sometimes impossible to figure out what has happened. The parts of the story I understood I liked, not loved. Apparently this book took some 13 years to write, and I think part of my problem following it was when the writer would set it down for a year or two then pick it up and start writing in a different way with a different idea of who the character was supposed to be. I could be wrong but that was the idea I got from reading this book. I heard my friend raving about how great this series is, I picked it up to see what she was talking about. After reading it front to back (and several chapters two or three times) I still have no idea what the fuss is about.
a great begging to an epic series To tell the truth I am not a huge king fan. I have tried to read a few of his books and just couldn't do it. Then one day a saw this book and thought that I might give it a try since it looked more like a fantasy novel than his usual horror novel. I had to read only about 10 pages in and I was hooked. I really like how he kept a lot of the stuff having to do with the tower a mystery. The only reason I didn't give this five stars is because it seemed like I had read the first chapter in a mutch larger story. Anyway if you like or don't like King this is a good book and I will now begin to read the sequal. Great job mister King you truly have a lot of talent when it comes to writing storys.
Good, if you're into this sort of thing... I can respect and appreciate this book. I think it's a very well-written story, in that you feel very connected with the main character's stream of thought the entire time rather than a sequence of events or concrete emotions. It made for a creative way of story-telling that I found intriguing. That being said, I think that this was perhaps a bit too abstract for me. However, I do feel like the remaining books in the series would make it come a little more full-circle.
Great Book Really good book despite being really short. I hope the rest of the books are as good as this one. If you enjoy reading Stephen King then you got nothing to lose by starting your journey along with Roland.
The Start Of a Masterpiece The epic joureny begins with Roland the last gunslinger. You slowly find out about Rolands past and his obsession with the Dark Tower. As Roland hunts for the tower on his neverending quest. You find out just how determined Roland is when he has to make sacifice that will haunt him but still Roland continues for the tower. The Dark tower is one best series in modern literature. An Epic mix of horror fantasy in a western time. These are by far the best books by Stephen King. Set in world of extaordinary circumstances filled with stunning visual imagery. Once read you them you wont want to stop. One of the most orignal series ever written So join Roland's quest for THE DARK TOWER.
I was totally asorbed from the first few minutes of story As a new listener of Stephen King, I did not expect to be drawn into the story by the characters. Each character comes to life so completely that you feel as if you know what they are thinking and feeling personally. I had thought of King as a author of horror, but this and the other titles in the Dark Tower series are not scary but rather a saga of a man who is committed to his quest of finding the Dark Tower. Some of the events seem a little like fantsy, but yet there is so much the reader can relate to that it is not a total trip into the unbelivable. I would recommend the entire Dark Tower Series to anyone who wants to be absorbed for hours. A totally wonderful series!!!!
....the Gunslinger Followed. "The Man in Black fled across the desert, and the Gunslinger followed". The Gunslinger is a quick introduction into the Dark Tower Series. I have read the series 3 times in 15 years, and plan to read it a couple more. Every time I read it I can't stop picturing Clint Eastwood, in one of his spaghetti westerns, as Roland. I love the way King can create a world, and make it seem so believable. Roland is the best hero / villain combined in one character I have ever found in a story. He does not let anything stand in the way of his relentless pursuit of the Man in Black. Although admittedly not the best book of the series, still very good, and necessary to complete the entire tale.
The second time around I have been reading Stephen King's works for a long time. I began the Dark Tower series when it first came out in paperback. I waited impatiently for the next book in the series to be published through the seventh and final book. Now I have decided to go back and reread all of the books again and purchase the hardcover editions to do it. I am amazed that the books are even more interesting now after the second reading. I can get into the story much deeper have the knowledge of where the characters will end up. And I see things I had either forgotten or didn't catch the first time. Stephen King is an amazing storyteller and I make sure I get everything he writes.
Everything leads up to this Nearly all of SKs books lead up to this series. From Pet Semetary to Insomnia, each of his books have been building up to this. This series is a definate must read and the twists and turns never stop until you close the last page. Literally.
Takes a few pages to get started. This one took a few pages to get started, but once it got going, it was tough to put this book down. This is definitley something different from the standard King novel. The main character is Roland of Gilead. The last of his breed of the once feared Gunslingers. From crossing the desert in search of "The Man In Black" to his shootout in a not so friendly town, this is the start of the best tale ever written. And the story isn't over yet. One of the first lines of the book is "The Man in Black crossed the desert. And the Gunslinger followed". Hopefully you will pick up this book and follow it's trail all the way to the end at the side of Roland.
Wow! For the longest I was looking around for a good book to read! I'm so used to non fiction and I wanted to change to fiction..I came across this book and let me tell you! Wow it is great! Diffrent but good! The words and language at some times had me thinking...but!! U get use to it. This first installment is great real good lots of action! It's fun all the way threw.the beging middle and end! If you want a good book then here you go dig in!
one of king's best books ever a very good fantasy with a western twist. the story starts out with a man named roland who is a gunslinger(a kind of knight meets cowboy in my opinion.)who is wandering through a desert looking for a notorious "man in black" who he believes will have the whereabouts of a place called the dark tower, that roland believes will have all the answers including the one of while the world has moved on without him. later roland befriends a kid named Jake who is from Earth. (note: roland is not from Earth but from another place.) and then thier adventure starts out after the dark man. i reccomend this to anyone who wants to read a great novel.
Outstanding This series of books are outstanding, absorbing, and surprisingly intellectual. The series is also very dark, much more so than I expected from the description on the back of the book, but King describes the moved on world with such poetic grace that one still wants to visit it. All in all one of the few literary masterpieces we have seen in the last few years, and will probably last for a long time into the future (although I think people 50 years from now will have a bit of trouble understanding the slang King loaded into "The Drawing of the Three"). King continues to surprise me by balancing his mediocre works with literary masterpieces.
The man in black fled across the desert... King draws you in to the alternate reality of Roland of Gilead by only hinting at the similarities and disparities between our worlds. There is clearly much that is left to know, but we are given a strong sense of the peril to Roland's world and, by association, our own. This short tale begins in the middle of Roland's quest to save the mythical Dark Tower from a danger we can only guess at, and leaves us as he begins the next stage of his journey. In between, we come to realize what the quest means to him through the sacrifices he is willing to make. For me, it's a masterful opening to a series that has all of us waiting anxiously for the continuation.
Intriguing! I first read this book when I was in high school around five years ago, when I borrowed it from a friend. I almost didn't give it back! Roland intrigued me, and the story just sucks you into the world that he lives in. You can't help but be drawn to the last gunslinger and his journey, the decisions that he had to make. Recently, as I was browsing at a book store, I saw these books again and-- I couldn't help it: I bought this and the next one right then and there. It made that big an impression on me. I'm not really a Stephen King reader -- he's talented but I never really was a fan. But this one-- the Dark Tower series will turn you into one.
Powerful Awesome start to the Darktower series, here we learn about Roland- the last gunslinger, learn a little of his past and get a glimpse into a dusty, dying world where time is skewed-different from our own, but what also seems connected to our own. We meet Jake, who is thrust into Rolands world from our world by the man in black, and learn of beings much more powerful than the man in black. Roland is shown a vision of his world and universe, and the possibility of infinite universes, his own place in time and space, and learns how his own world is dying. Its a mix of sci-fi, fantasy, and western with a touch of-or even underlying- romanticism.
malevolent! The gunslinger is the first of four awesome books. People who read it don't usually don't enjoy it and this saddens me too often. To my opinion this is the shortest yet the best written book of the series and one of the best books ever to be written. Whithin it lies a great mystery that opens a path to the Dark Tower. I feel that this book is very difficulr to read and grasp. To grasp it, one needs to be deeply inside the gunslinger's mind. Enjoying the series of books starts in enjoying "the gunslinger". Give it a thought before you give in and compensate by reading the second book (which is far less difficult to read).
Maybe the rest of his books are great, but not this one just too uninteresting and hard to follow. I read 20+ novels a year and thought I'd try reading one of Stephen King's books, because he lives locally. I toughed it out and forced my way to page 100, after which I thought "i'll never get that time back". Maybe the rest of his books are great, but not this one.
great reat! After getting up to date on the Kingkiller chronicles and the Demon Cycle series and after having already finished the WOT, Mistborn series and many other amazing fantasy novels I was hesitant of a fantasy series written by Stephen King but after reading the first book in the Dark tower series I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. The book was well written, the characters were fun and the story thus far has me enthralled. I eagerly look forward to reading the rest of the series.
I'm hooked I had never heard of the Dark Tower series until I saw this one sitting on a store shelf. Having always been a King fan I picked up the paperback and decided to give it a try. From the very opening of the book I was hooked. Since then I've picked up The Gunslinger on hardcover and finished up to book four. If you're a fan of any epic story, this is a series for you. The Roland character lives up to every classic hero and even adds some twists. While at first it seemed that King "rambled" on here and there about things, I've found that his terse explanations have painted an incredibly vivid picture that won't go away.
Un hijo para King. De todos los libros que he leido de este autor esta saga es, sin lugar a dudas, la mejor. No posee ese suspenso y terror a bestias salvajes, demonios o zombies sino que tiene un terror a lo que tenemos adentro. Este libro muestra el interior de cada uno de los personajes sus odios, sus miedos, sus penas y sus amores. Una historia que comienza con un hombre solo y que pronto se convierte en una aventura de varios. Como bien dice el señor King esta obra es su hijo ya que el puso toda su dedicacion y mejor talento en el. La saga de la torre oscura es una saga para tener en todas las casas de los amantes del genero. Nicolas Pierri.
One of King's Best I do like King, although some of my friends call his works a literary slum, and I think that The Gunslinger may be one of his more important works. The choices that must be made by the hero, Rolland, are exaggerated examples of those that we must all deal with. Do we pursue our dreams at all costs or lie broken and admit defeat? The fantasy of the story only adds to its charm. The way that King has mixed the legend of the Old West Gunslinger with sorcery and magic is interesting, involving, and elegant. This is perfect for those that do not want to dig too deep for meaning, but, at the same time, do not want a meaningless read.
The beginning is important Though the criticisms I have seen on this book are not entirely innacurate, there is something that everyone thus far has overlooked. Even though the pace of this book is not near that of the others, this book offers insight into what the Roland of "today" is. Without this book, there would be no meaning to Roland's insanity in The Wastelands, and also no measure of how much Roland changes throughout the series...So in that light, I think that this is one of the most functional and important books in the series. DO NOT try to read the series without this book...The rest lose a LOT of meaning without it.
I almost forgot how much I love this So many poignant quotes. I love Roland, and his constant internal struggle. The man in black is always laughing in his face. I am ready to start the next one. I am looking forward to retreading the entire series.
King's best? The reason this is one of my favorite books of all time has nothing to do with the science fiction or fantasy aspects of it, or the writing itself, which is terrific, but because it's so un-King like. At its root, it's about the yearning inside every man to conquer something seemingly unconquerable, a theme brought out beautifully in the final twenty pages. There is no reason to even read beyond the first book of the cycle, everything you need to feel is right here in this one. People who have nothing but distaste for Stephen King would never believe he could write this well. I like this book even more so than The Stand.
The Gunslinger, Stephen King Stephen King, like many authors, writes for assignment and for himself. the Gunslinger; The Dark Tower, was written for himself from the heart. Roland, a Knight in not so shining armor, pursues the Dark Tower; a nexus of time and worlds. He has an undisclosed purpose that leads his followers to a loyalty to the death. In this first of many books the beginning is slow, steady and paced. It is a bit difficult for a young reader but is well remembered for its finish and promise of more. He does deliver in future books as well. Roland is a vivid character and the world he lives in is well populated with promise and disaster.
Excellent King's DT series is nothing short of excellent. While some would argue that the series lacks cohesion and that some compelling ideas are introduced but never explored (particularly in the 3rd installment), King's heros' journey is still simply incredible. If a mixing of flavors on one big plate is appealing (fantasy, sci-fi, romance, western) these books will deliver. It's Tolkien, Owen Whister, and Akira Kurosawa all in one place. As a point of interest, this series is the nexus of many of King's other books - The Stand, Hearts in Atlantis, Eyes of the Dragon, and 'Salem's Lot to name a few connections.
A very fun ride I've read several of Stehen King's books, I think the Gunslinger is a very easy read, you can finish it in one afternoon. The story is not overly complicated, but it keeps you turning the page. I don't like giving plot "spoilers" I'll just say the reader follows a man on a mission of revenge, and Stephen King sure knows how to create a "moody" setting, this book gives you the "chills" in a sense because it's a dark post-apocalyptic type world where the reader can constantly feel the tension! I haven't read the entire saga that follows but this book has whetted my appetite and I may read the whole saga.
The Dark Tower l I enjoyed reading this book . The first time I tried to read was some years back and could not wrap my head around it . Now am ready forefathers whole series . I have many of Kings books and have enjoyed them all especially Under The Dome !!! You really need to read that BOOK soon to be on TV.
Enjoyable enough to continue on to book 2... I've been a Stephen King fan since I was about 9 and 20 years later I'm finally taking on one of the Dark Tower novels I've heard fantasy nerds rave about. I find this entire genre perplexing and have held my nose up around those who enjoy this sort of thing. King seems to just be warming up in this brief novel (and at 8 books and counting, he certainly was just getting started) about The Gunslinger and his quest to capture "the man in black." As I sort of figured I would, I enjoyed the opening salvo, an ode to westerns. The further the book got the more the narrative turned to talk of wizards and fate and Fate. If this were anyone other than an already highly regarded author such as King, I would no doubt have been rolling my eyes in parts. Some scenes were rather memorable and exciting and I loved the paintings included. I look forward to reading book two with equal parts excitement and trepidation.
A great novel with lots of twists. The Gunslinger is a carnivorous style of writing mixed in with a well-developed character driven story. I really loved this book. It's action was fast and well thought out. Meaning it wasn't just a "shoot and kill" type of story. King's characters seem to move with million of calculations in each step.Although some of the characters are a little out of place, they go along with the contrast the entire has with itself. Also, the back stories will keep you guled to the rest of the Darktower series. There are a lot of great twists and turns. I highly recommened this novel.
This one will get you hooked! I wasn't much of a novel reader before I was given a King novel (IT) by my mother. She opened the door to Stephen King's world, and I haven't closed it since. I just finished what I consider to be the best book I have ever read, "The Gunslinger." This book is the epidimy of writing. I was entranced by this book. I finished it in one week, a personal record. And now I am starting on "Drawing of The Three." I only hope this story gets better, as I hear it does. I hope to one day understand Rolands's seemingly foggy past. And maybe one day I can reach the Tower. MSM
Phenomenal Phenomenal! I love this book. Its the beginning of a series that will take you places you could never predict or foresee. This one, Wizard and Glass and The Drawing of the Three are my favorites but for sure read them all in order. This one is pretty slow going for a while, but dig in and make it through, you will not be disappointed you did. It's not very long compared to the others so its not slow for long. Enjoy it, I did.
I'm HOOKED I'm not a big fan of King. I read The Shinning and The Stand back when I was a kid and never really understood what the big deal was. Sure he has a great writing style but the man doesn't seem to know how to write an ending. The ONLY book of his that I enjoyed before this one was The Eyes of the Dragon. So usually when I'm looking over paperbacks I skip over the King books. What drew me to this one was the idea of a western/horror novel.(Plus it was on sale for only $6) I've always been a big fan of both genres and the idea of them coming together intrigued me. So I gave it a whirl and am glad that I did. I really enjoyed Roland's style and the bits of back history that King drops in from time to time. He really drew me in and I'm happy to say that I'll be giving The Dark Tower series a chance. I just hope King doesn't let me down in the big finale.
Absolutely Amazing After reading many of King's books throughout high school and later into college, I readily tired of the visual allegory attempted by a writing style that I associated more with script writing. The Gunslinger, however, completely changed my expectations of all science fiction and fantasy authors. The unusual writing style, the changing mental patterns and awareness of the characters is stunning and creates a challenge to read and understand. For those tiring of the Forgotten Realms style drivel, immerse yourself in a book that has the power to change your perceptions of the genre.
Patchy in parts This book was mostly pretty good & enjoyable but it wasn't awesome, even with Stephen King's updated revisions. Stephen King himself admits readers may find this book difficult to get into. I've decided to persevere & I'm halfway through the next book which is so much better. This book is the shortest in the series so it's worthwhile reading it. I feel that I should mention that if you struggled with this book & got through it you will be rewarded by picking up book 2. If I was able to give half marks, I'd give this 3.5 stars as even though it is good there are some slow spots.
Loved it! I put off reading this series for a while but I'm so glad King finished so I could get started. My mind was blown at the end when there is a discussion about size and relativity. Wow can't wait to read the next one!!
the gunslinger the first line of the first chapter caught my attention at the library but after going home and starting the book, i grudingly went on to the last page; only because i've never not finished a book when started. i've never liked stephen king when i was younger but now, i've lightly grasped what makes him such a good writer. i say only read this book so that you can get into the second, third and fourth. after each, i craved to read the next. i didn't crave into obsession, but still, this series was good enough to go on. the characters are genuine but the main one, the best.
A Decent Read This is my first read-through of The Gunslinger, so my opinion is that of one who does not know anything about the story of The Dark Tower beyond the first book. On its own, its a Decent Read. As one reviewer put more elegantly, the novel is short on action and heavy on atmosphere. An appropriate way I'd describe it would be 'weird', which is definitely not a bad thing. In the foreward, King talks about how the story is inspired by the Spaghetti Western Films of Sergio Leone (mainly his 'Dollars' trilogy) and Tolkien's 'The Lord of the Rings'. Its too bad that the story doesn't contain much humor or action akin to Leone's films, or the epic-scale and wonder of Tolkien's story. I do, however, understand that this novel is essentially one long setup for the premise of the series, and that is most likely doesn't pick up until the sequel . . .
What . . . . happened? What a strange little book. The entire series is weird, but this one is just ... plain ... strange. That's not to say it's not good ... in a strange sort of way. You should read it first, just to get the feel for how strange some of the much longer (and better) books later in the series can get, but this is the poorest of the four out so far. I finished this irritated by the gunslinger (although he hadn't reached the heights of irritatingness he would reach in Part IV) and his little friend, Jake. I don't know why I'm recommending this, but I am. Strange.
A very slow start, but worth sticking with the series This review might contain small spoilers for later books in the series. I found the story of The Gunslinger difficult to follow in the beginning. Just being tossed into a fantasy world without much description of it's general history I found to be a little confusing. As the book progressed I found it became easier to follow (maybe it just took me some time to get into the story). I really enjoyed the overlap with pieces of the 'real' world. My favorite character was Jake, and I was disappointed when it seemed that his storyline would be cut short. Overall I didn't really care for this book, but the introduction to key characters and the world in general makes it essential to continue the series. I'm on book five now, and really liked the books after this one. So if you read this one and you're not sure if you want to continue, at least give the second book a try before calling it quits.
Sets the hook for the rest of the books After reading several of King's book I kept noticing references to other stories by the author with the same themes. I was eventually directed to the "Dark Tower" series and this, the first of seven, sets the stage for this epic journey in a time shifting futuristic landscape. I could't wait to start the next book and see how the deep thinking, quick as lightning, gunslinger "Roland" meets his destiny as foretold by "the man in black" If you would like a sci-fi post apocalyptic, prophecy driven story, this is it. Sorry it took so long to find this gem!
Vintage King - Recommended for Fantasy Fans Fantasy fans, please note that this book is usually located in the HORROR section in book stores. I liked the character of the "Evil" enchanter, whom I thought was the most charismatic and enigmatic character in the novel. Most of all, I loved the haunting, dreamlike quality of the novel. Compare this book to, say, Donaldson's "Mirror of Her Dreams", and you'll see how masterful King is in setting up the characters, context, and the mood with economic precision. The ending leaves the reader shaking with anticipation for the sequel.
This is my favorite Stephen King. I am an avid reader of Stephen Kings books, but I have to admit thie Dark Tower series is my favorite. This is my 4th reading. Re-visiting and re-aquainting myself with Roland and all the other characters in the books is something I truly enjoy. What a fresh and wonderful idea. I know of no other books that even come close to Mr. Kings idea for this great story. I'll be eternally surprised at all the nuances and adventures I have forgotten between readings. Even though the series is long each book is fresh and full of new adventures and characters. Can't recommend this series highly enough. Even if you aren't a big fan of Stephen King this series is well worth reading, and re-reading. On to the next book, need to catch up so I can continue on to the newest books in the series.
good book The Gunslinger by Stephen King is a great book. It has everything that you would expect from this exceptional author. It has horror, suspense, violence, and relationships. There is a great balance between action and suspense, with just the right amount of filler and details between action sequences. It even has the epic struggle between good and evil that has become so important in most Stephen King books. In my opinion, it it the best Stephen king book I have ever read and I'm looking foreward to reading the other books in The Dark Tower series.
Strangely enticing book Interesting approach to a "Western" style novel. I am not fond of Westerns, even though I am a Texan. I found the novel to draw enough from other genre to keep me pulled in and reading further; enough so, to have me starting the next book in the series.
Compelling protagonist! Definitely a signature King work and one I had meant to read for many years now. Roland is compelling and well-developed. As his history is revealed, your entanglement in his world and his quest is almost inevitable. His reprehensible traits are well-balanced with his admirable, making him a rich character to follow. I look forward to his continuing adventures!
Can't wait to read the new publication The Dark Tower series is crucial to the reading and understanding of Steven King's world. This addition has been revisited and expanded buy King to better tie in with the rest of the series. I am waiting in agony for all 4 Dark Tower books to be published in a couple of days, even if my bank account is empty after that. Other amazing books are The Talisman and Black House, cowritten by Peter Straub, with are also important to the Dark Tower, along with The Stand, and just about every other King book. Each book has a suspenseful ending that will make you need the next book ready and waiting for you to finish.
The Gunslinger This book is very fascinating. It's full of suspense and mysteries that will make you want to read more. I recommend this to older people there is some cursing and is fairly difficult to read because it jumps to different parts and mentions different characters. This book is one of the best I ever read. This book is about a future world with a desert wanderer called the Gunslinger. This book didn't teach me anything but it gave me a bigger imagination and made me think creatively. Stephen King did a good job writing this book.
The Gunslinger This book is very fascinating. It's full of suspense and mysteries that will make you want to read more. I recommend this to older people there is some cursing and is fairly difficult to read because it jumps to different parts and mentions different characters. This book is one of the best I ever read. This book is about a future world with a desert wanderer called the Gunslinger. This book didn't teach me anything but it gave me a bigger imagination and made me think creatively.

one of Stephen King's best!! I actually think this is Stephen King's magnum opus well at least the start. The full series is well worth a read and then a reread! The condition of the book from my order was well beyond my expectations. It was an older copy but was in perfect condition. The arrival of my order was sooner than expected so all in all my expectations were well met!
Start of an Epic This amazing story starts out with the Gunslinger chasing the man in black in a world that has moved on. The book is just great. It entraps you in the gunslinger's world and makes it where you don't want to leave. This book is loaded with lots of action and it is very exciting. The world seems like the Spaggitti westerns with Clint Eastwood and that is a good thing. The gunslinger is just an amazing character that just simply cant be beat. I believe this book is for anyone but if you read this one you will want to read the others.
The Dark Tower 1 Brilliant Intro by Steven King and as a great lover of Steven King books I have waited to read the Dark Tower as it is now complete. I look forward to the many adventures that only Steven King can take you on.
The Beginning One of King's first books written, but not published, this tale starts off the best story of all time. It begins in the middle of the tale, but by the end, you MUST know what happens next! This story draws you into a world like ours, but subtly different. It will keep you spellbound, turning the pages faster and faster. As a stand alone tale, it is nice, but as the beginning of the Dark Tower saga, it is superb. Overall, the Saga is perhaps King's greatest work, and no fan can be without the series.
painfully slow. As many other reviewers have mentioned this book took me OVER a year and a half to trench through.. It's only 300 pages but its so painfully slow, It picks up about halfway through, Otherwise this is a good book, however I literally had to go back SEVERAL times to re-read certain chapters because there are so many words and painfully slow description of things you want to bang your head against the wall. I seriously considered putting the book down for good and walking away and start reading The Drawing of the three next. On the other hand I have had friends who loved this book. Perhaps my attention span sucks..
The best yet This book had me hooked from when I started it and read the opening line of "The man in black fled across the desert and the gunslinger followed". The world that King creates is so strangely like our own. The only thing about this book is that he spends too much time on flashbacks and doesnt explain enough about them. It takes only a little away from the book and the rest is enough to keep you reading long into the night. I cant wait to get the next one! Keep writing Mr. King, and give us a 5th book soon!
A biginnig of great siries When you will read this book you won't understand a lot of things (where, when). but dont afraid to waste time this book is so intresting and beutifly written that you will find yourself buying the following books in this siries. in them you will discover a holl new world that will follow you in your dreams. King succeded to make a wonderful mix of fantasy humor action and science fiction that I never met in any book. (I gave this book only 4 points comparing to the others in this series, atherwise it worse 5)
Slow but vital The Gunslinger is a necessarily slow introduction to the vast universe called Midworld and the samurai like gunslingers who control it. Midworld has "moved on", the Dark Tower is weakening, and Roland, the last gunslinger, has accepted as his Ka the job of righting the damage begun by The Ageless Stranger. Be glad that you have The Drawing of the Three to move on to, and continue this masterful saga of interwoven lives and worlds as Roland begins to shape his Ka-tet for the terrible journey ahead.
Second Time Around I chose this rating for the entertainment value of this novel & its story line. I am a true Stephen King fan & loved The Dark Tower series so have decided to re-read them! The Gunslinger introduces you to Roland a character you are unable to forget & who you will always want to know more about! His world becomes your world & ypu will never get enough
great book, but very confusing once again stephen king has written a book that hurts my head. this book is about roland of gilead, a man who has dedicated his life to finding something called the dark tower, and will kill anyone who stops him from doing so. in the gunslinger, roland is looking for the man in black, someone who may have the answers to where the dark tower is located. this book is very confusing and many questions aren't aswered until the books that come later in the series. but trust me, this book is so good that you wnat to keep reading even though you have no idea what is happening. follow me on twitter @jacobcote4 to see what book i'm reviewing next
Great Vision ... Fair Execution Unbelievable vision of a world that has moved on ... the vision is incredible, and as part of the dark tower series is an excellant introduction. it is interesting to see how King's writing evolves over the course of the narrative. it starts in this one, sparse, and quite uneven -- though his additions and expansions have addressed the worst of it -- but by the time the wastelands rolls arounds, he is literally writing classics. all in all, read the series, and to do so, read this one first.
An amazing start to a fascinating journey It might seem like a strange read at first, and it totally is! Consider this the prologue, if you will, to a "being John Malkovich"-esque, time-travelling post-apocalyptic (sort of) journey that will challenge your concept of story-telling. It is remarkably clever, insane and unpredictable.
enjoyed this series from the first book (SPOILERS)... liked the first maybe 5 novels of the series better than the last few but overall, really liked it. Roland is a strong, interesting hero, capable and no nonsense. the last of the series where he's shown to be insane is sad, but Stephen King even made that work. definitely worth reading
The Gunslinger What a great way to open a story, "The man in black fled across the desert and the Gunslinger followed." The Gunslinger is the first book in Stephen Kings Dark Tower series. In this first book we meet Roland Deschain, the last of the Gunslingers who at first seems like a simple cowboy chasing someone across the desert. This quickly changes as we learn more and more about Roland, his dying world, and the man in black. With a mixture of a western movie, fantasy, sci-fi and mystery The Gunslinger is the start of an adventure that follow Roland's quest for the Dark Tower. This is not your typical Stephen King story; instead it is an epic journey that touches many of the books King has written over the years tying his universe together in a fun and unique way.
Interesting read I'll be perfectly honest right up front. This book took a while for me to get into. It seemed to drag on for a while before it started picking up. Once it picked up, I couldn't put it down. Roland is a character with a deep rich history that i would have loved to have read more of, but that comes later in the series. No let down here. Four stars because it took so long to get going. Definitely worth picking up if you want a series that is fairly well screwed up as only King can do them!
First review My first Stephen King novel, and boy, I am pleasantly surprised! Everything about this book captivated me. The only downside with this book is that it shoots you into action with no background knowledge of the dark tower universe, making the story feel thin at first.
new stuff every time This is the third and not the last time I've read this book. First time was in 92, second time in 02, and again in 14. This time I'm reading the books in much quicker succession and seeing more than I had before. I enjoyed reading these under the perspectives of a teenager, a 20 something, and now pushing 40.
The start of a journey everyone should take Opening with some of the most haunting and yet simple words you've ever read; "The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed." Stephen Kings seven book series started with the humble 216 novel that introduced you to a man with a purpose. Roland the gunslinger is one of the greatest characters I've ever encountered and is one of my favorite. Purposeful, deliberate, and unwavering, he is a man with a mission that he does not stray from his whole life.
I liked it!!! I must say I like this book. when I was younger I tried reading one of the dark towers ,but it it Down within the first chapter. so I decided to give it another try for the first volume. I almost gave up again but glad I kept, now I moving on to the second towers
ROLAND ROLAND ROLAND I started to read this book many times. Most of you know that sometimes steve drags it out a little bit. Finally, I forced myself past the first few chapters and thank god I did. I read Wizard and Glass a few weeks back and I nearly fell over with sheer delight.The Drawing of the Three was my favorite until then. At any rate, I have read almost everything Steve has put out and I must say that the world is a better place for having him. Or my world is anyhow. peace, ace
The start of something very special This saga is so different than anything Stephen King has ever written and truly unique. It's the shortest of the books in the Gunslinger series and a good opening to a magnificent adventure. I had this book on my shelves for years and couldn't get into it. I tried to read it twice and gave up after the first 20 pages or so. A few years back, I decided to give it another chance and read the book in just a few hours. Once I got a feeling for the story, I really found myself able to get into the world that King was describing. This book is not at all dynamic by itself, but it sets up a foundation for what is to become the best series I've ever read. Do yourself a favor and give this a read...and then the next book...and so on. You will not be disappointed. Once you enter the world of Roland of Gilead, The Last Gunslinger, you will never want to leave.
The Dark Tower Series Part of the Dark Tower series of books, this is truly exceptional writing by Mister King. I can never put these books down. They are strange but for some reason, totally believable! This is a story that could go on for ever and ever. I really enjoy reading these books and it seems as if each new episode of the story just gets better and better. If you decide to read these series, I recommend you start from the first book and work your way down the whole series.
Exactly what I was expecting I actually already own a copy of this book. However, I'm currently don't have access to it, so I decided to buy it again. I wanted a particular version of the book (basically the one pictured in the preview images), and that's exactly what I got. The book quality was good, despite it being a used copy. I am very satisfied with this purchase.
A gripping tale The book was well written with great character development. I do believe this book was too short, that some parts of the book were rushed and there were points when I lost interest due to little or no fluidity between the past references and the main storyline. Some of the pieces he wrote just seemed to be page fillers with no point. A tragic book but in the end it was a good read.
Adventurous and exciting, a fanstastic book!! This book is one of my favorite-ever books. It definatly is not for the young reader. It has some vulgar language, and many chapters are all about killing. But for the older and more matuer reader, it is a classic. The book concerns a dark man who wanders through the desert after nuclear war wiped out most of the world. He is on a quest to find the man in black, who he has been following most of his life. A mist read for science fiction lovers!!
Kings masterpiece. I am very late to start reading this series but I am very glad that I started. I finished this book in only one day which is a rarity for me, but it was so well written that I could not help myself. The Gunslinger is by far my favorite Stephen King character to date. He is mysterious, there's alot to learn about him, and I think he looks like Clint Eastwood from back in the day. Despite this book being short a lot does happen and you might not understand it all, but no worries because there is 7 more books to learn from. Any King fan or someone looking for a long series to read needs to read this book.
A wonderful masterpiece, one of Stephen Kings best works yet The Gunslinger is one of Stepehn Kings greatest novels written to date. It is an epic saga of good versus evil. Roland the last of the Gunslingers fills us with awe as we join him in his journey to the Dark Tower to save his dying world. Throughout his journey Roland is searching for the ominous Man in Black, who supposedy knows the direction to the Dark Tower. To meet The Man in Black Roland has to look at his past and defeat his inner demons
Stephens King's beginning of his lord of the rings The gunslinger is great. It's the beginning of the epic dark tower series. The whole book is sort of introducing the gunslinger character and showing you what makes him tick, and why he does the things he does. It's not my favorite of the series, even in some parts getting boring or lull but still a great read and filled with great imagination has always with Stephen king. But a great introduction to a epic opus series.
A Must Read The Gunslinger (The Dark Tower, Book 1) is a Must Read for all who love interesting and imaginative story telling. From beginning to end the story grips you and doesn't let you go. Stephen King has written a real work of art with this book. You'll find yourself rooting for Roland, and the boy from New York called Jake. Other characters like Alice and the Man in Black add great depth to the story as well. This is a book you don't want to miss, and shouldn't. I loved it and know you will too.
The Gunslinger The Gunslinger is a fabulous story (really only the first chapter) about the last knight in a world which has "moved on" and is dying around him, and about his quest to save it. The storytelling abilities of Stephen King fully shine through, and this story is certainly worthy of him - fascinating, brilliantly told, and engrosing. I bought the second book shortly before I finished this one, so I wouldn't have to stop reading!
Well-crafted Story! This is book one of The Dark Tower series; it could stand on its own if someone actually wanted to only read The Gunslinger. I will not be that person. What a great story. It was crafted so gradually, I had no idea what was really going on until the end - which is how a great book is written. It sort of sucked me in one page at a time. The book is about a man tracking another man - and throughout the story we find out why - and where we are in time. That's it. So simple, yet this story is so full of nuances that I couldn't put it down. I am officially all-in on this series and can't wait to start the next book!
Intriguing... The first part of the part was strange and a bit confusing. Perhaps that was the point. The second part of the book picked up the pace. Jake was a memorable character and the choice of the gunslinger with regards to Jake broke my heart. The meeting with the man in black was a bit anti-climatic. However, by the end of the book, I liked the gunslinger, even with his terrible flaws. I will continue with this highly acclaimed series.
I didn't really get it I just don't like the fantasy genre. I couldn't get through The Hobbit, I didn't get into Wizard's First Rule, and I didn't like The Dark Tower. My problem is that I can't put the characters and actions into context when they inhabit a world created by the author. In The Dark Tower, the gunslinger is following The Man in Black and questing for the Dark Tower. Why? It's not explained. Where did the Man in Black come from? No answer. The book does give all sorts of details on the gunslinger's past and how he became what he is, but it's some crazy other-world that doesn't makes sense and just raises more questions than it answers. Some people just love the Fantasy genre, but I still don't get it.
Intensely engaging. With "The Gunslinger," Stephen King hooked me for life. Never before had I read a tale so haunting, so eerie and engaging that I was forced to read it again and again. Brilliantly devised situations and desolate landscapes focus the tale about the inner workings of a troubled hero. King produces his most memorable character to date in the form of Roland. His quest, shady and romantic, urges the audience to read on.
The first step in a long walk. Stephen King somewhat strays from his usual wicked, haunting, tales by exploring a deeper side of his talent. The Dark Tower Series is by far one of the most arresting storylines you will ever come across. By the end of the Gunslinger, you will realize how fortunate you are not to have to wait 4 years for the next book to come out. Take your time reading the other three because waiting on a new one is a task....believe me.
Thinking about reading book despite the slow start I had a tough time getting through the book. Every time I turned the page I kept hoping for some kind of reveal or explanation. Or for something to happen. It's so mysterious about the world and its characters, it was almost infuriating for the first half of the book. It does improve in the final third. The action picked up a bit and some flashbacks made the weirdness more tolerable, or at least gave it some backstory. I thought I'd get into the series, but this was a disappointing start for me. I felt like I was trudging through someone's demented acid trip.
Without Question, This is Stephen King at his BEST! I will keep my thoughts and veiws breif, because I am not a professional writer,but I have to tell the world that this series of novells by King is Brilliant, and to those who read this, you have to go and find Wizard And Glass. This is the 4th book in the series of the Dark Tower. It is avalible now, and if you are a cassette junkie like myself who loves to hear King read his work It is going to be avalible on November 4th
Give it a chance! I've read most of the other reviews on this book and it seems to be at one extreme or another in terms of ratings. To those of you who gave the book a poor rating, I only ask that you give the book a chance. It's hard to appreciate this book without reading the rest of the series. I recently went back and read The Gunslinger again after reading the rest of the series and found it to be a much better read.
For the true fantasy fans. This book was great. I will definitely continue reading the series. The universe that King has created is complex and intriguing. This is not a western. That was my main concern when I picked it up. I didn't want to read a western. This is a fantasy quest, along the lines of Lord of the Rings, but gritty, dark, and not nerdy. I am now reading the comics, which are based on the book, and they are beautiful.
Obscurity is a beautiful thing. Ok im a kid and im 14. After reading this book i don't understand how someone couldn't like this book. It is obscure, but that adds so much. This isn't an everyday crappy "scary" novel that is like all of the rest. It has an amazingly original plot like no other. I can understand (i guess) why someone wouldn't respect this because it takes an intelligent person to understand and appreciate a book like this. Its definatley worth a read.
Don't mess with The Gunslinger... The Gunslinger is the book that introduced us to Roland and his painstaking adventure. What can i say apart from this is a masterpiece, and probably isnt given as much credit as it should. I too, was a little apprehensivewhen picking this book up, being so used to his other works, but i have never regretted it. i'll be starting book 6 soon, and not one of the others have disappointed me.
Awesome! Being a huge Stephen King fan, I was eager to read this book once I found out about the Dark Tower series. The book immediately drew me in and I soon read the other 3 books that had already been published. The final, 7th book was a Christmas present that I cannot wait to read. The Gunslinger draws the reader into Roland's life immediately, although if you do not typically read Stephen King styled writers, The Gunslinger may be... wierd.
Absolute Must Read We all know Stephen King and his works, however, this series by far is the greatest I've ever read. I cannot wait to read the next page, the next chapter, the next book. This book starts out a little difficult to follow, but stick with it. If you've ever read Tolkein's Hobbit, you will understand the need to keep reading. This is masterful and quite unlike King's absolute horror books. Keep reading.
Excellent story and series! Phenomenal! King is always great. A great book to start my 10 year old on for appreciating Mr. King and his writing style! I forgot about the "bad words" though, good thing she's smart enough to ask about them. Looks like I need to re-read all of them again.
THE SAGA BEGINS One of the greatest works of fantasy, Mr. King jumps easily from horror to this genre. And isn't the usually big-almost-without-an-end book that he usually writes, is not too big, yet is long enough. And it left you wanting to read the sequel. This is one of the best of Stephen King, a saga that will last longer than him, hopefully he will get to write the other 3 sequels to end this 7 part saga.
My absolute favorite The Dark Tower series is my absolute favorite literature. It's just good entertainment. If you think you don't like Stephen King, try this series. It's not horror, it's fantasy, and even a bit of sci-fi. You may not like one or two parts, but the whole story is amazing. No matter how many are in the series, I will be forever waiting for the next one! That's the kind of hold it gets on you!
The Beginning Right now I am wondering where this story leads. I'm not sure how the pieces I've been given fit together. I don't mind the ride and will read onto book two. I know I will have more questions after I'm through with it but hopefully ill start to beta better understanding of the Gunslinger.
Much better then normal horror by king - bounders on sci fi The gunslinger is a hero with a moral and ethical code that guides him on the path of his quest. While not a fan of most of Stephan King's other horror type book, I found this very enjoyable, bringing in science fiction type view of a future world and one man's quest to reverse/repair what has caused his world to 'move on'. Main problem is that the next book in the series has not come out yet
The Real Stephen King People who think Stephen King is just a horror author are wrong, in fact this series is the core ideaology of all his books, and it happens to be more of a fantasy/sci fi book than a horror. If you're new to King, this is a great place to start. The first book is pretty tough to get through, but it really picks up from here, especially at Wizard Glass Cheers! Sean
I rather enjoyed this book. I rather enjoyed this book. I found it quite entertaining and exciting. The book had a lot of action, although it was quite violent, I still enjoyed it. I feel that Stephen King should continue writing further on this series, past "Wizard and Glass". I, myself, will coninue to read, and keep up with the Dark Tower series as long as it continues on. Thank you for listening.
Excellant! Personally, this was one of the best books I have read in a long time. The story follows a man on a lonely journey to pursue the mysterious man in black who holds the secret to his future. The scenes are dazzling and the symbolism will blow you away. This book will keep you reading until the climatic end with a special scifi twist to it. I definately give this book five stars :)
The Epitome of Fantasy... The First in a series of wonderful books, The Gunslinger takes the reader on a completely unexpected and yet familiar path. I read the whole freakin' thing in a day! It engulfed my interests and attention completely and wouldn't let go. It is most definetely my favorite book of all time (besides Insomnia). In closing, I implore you: Please read this book. You have no clue...
Just getting started As his first book in the Dark Tower series, it captivated me enough to continue to the second book. The book entangles you into the life of Roland the gunslinger. After reading it I just had to continue to see what would happen next. Very riveting book. I know some were discouraged with the first book and if you are one of those people... keep on going. You'll be glad you did.
AAAAAAAAAGGGGGRRRRRHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I didn't want to pick it up. I knew it would happen. Like that damned Corona Beer, I got addicted. Great book, Mr. King. In one week I have followed Roland passed the way station, the three doors and now I'm with him and eddie and Sussanah shooting satalite dishes off gate gaurdians. I bought the paperbacks. I'm getting the hardcovers for my daughter. Thanks for the Tower. I travel there every time my boss opens her mouth.
This is the book that started me on King... This book has been out for years, and even if I had never read it I would love it if I read it today. This is the book that started my enjoyment of reading. I read this book when it first came out in paperback, and it was so enjoyable that I became a true 'reader.' Even if you don't like some of the King books that have came out lately, this one will not let you down.
Worth the wait, but how many more are there going to be? Oh boy, have I ever been waiting a long time for this book! I finished it in about 2 days, and loved every page. The story continues to be riveting, and the character of Roland is one of King's best creations. Good stuff, I highly recommend this book. Now, Mr. King, if you could only write these books more often than one every five years. Talk about an epic saga!
Excellent Stephen King Story, Unlike any of the others Stephen King's masterpiece, The Dark Tower Series has to be one of the best story I've ever read. They get better and better with each book. Without going through the storyline, which you can read in the review, I will simply state that he can make another dimension seem not only real, but surreal. I highly recommend this book. - Marjorie Spoto, Author - When It Rains.
Not as enjoyable as I had hoped Couldn't get past the first few pages. Stephen King is a master of concepts but his books rarely live up to his vision. Will give it another go at some point and I have heard the following books after better.
GUNSLINGER ROCKS, NUFF SAID I know, I know, I am kind of playing favorites here, but I throughly enjoyed this novel. I read mainly VERY long fantasy epics, like right now the Wheel of Time and Shannara trilogy, so when I am overwhelmed by these, I turn to this old favorite. It's a good quick read, and it's so entertaining. Besides, how can you go wrong with such a combo like this book offers?
Intriguing Second time reading this book. Can't wait to re-read the rest of the series. Roland is an interesting character. We keep learning more about him as the story unfolds, but we don't really get to know him well enough.
Classic King. this is not the first time I have read this book. The Dark Tower draws me to it every so often. I enjoy the fact that it is western and mythical at the same time. I believe that the Dark Tower is Kings best writing!
Brilliant The shortest book in the series, The Gunslinger represents an extraordinary introduction to The Dark Tower books. Stephen King struggled to write this over the course of a decade, but it makes for a pleasant read. We meet The Gunslinger, as he chases The Man In Black across the desert. I don't want to spoil anything, but please do not lose your patience if you fear you'll have to wait until book 7 for these two to have a confrontation. Excellent.
Can't wait for the next installment, due summer '97! I wasn't real hot on reading this series. My 18-year old son always recommends books to me that he wants to share, and this was a definite winner. King starts out piquing your interest from the very beginning and then you can't wait to finish. I read The Drawing of the Three and am now reading The Wastelands. Anxiously awaiting the next installment
awesome(not a fantasy reader) I'll be quick to say that I don't read fantasy, unless it's obviously a book like the Gunslinger. I love king and this is why I picked this one up. I hate to say that I haven't read the entire series, but the first 3 that I have read are awesome. Gunslinger gives you a nice introduction to Roland and the world he lives in. Great and entertaining book.
Three Stars This is a very strange beginning to a GREAT series.
Roland Roland is a wonderful charactor, a woman's man? Love, betrayal. Bravery, Fear. Mystery, and no- nonsense all rolled into one ( the real hang-em- high man ). I have read all the Dark Tower books that are released to date, ( HINT, HINT Mr. King! :) and look forward to more of Roland in the future. ( secretly in love with Roland, can you tell?)
Yahoo! A good start with book one of the Dark Tower series. As it says in the intro to the book, and I must agree, this book does not do the total series justice. Anyone deciding to start this series, I would recommend pushing through this book. It is good but the next is so much better and you will thank me once you get there. Enjoy Stephen King fans.
Inspirational The very fact that it took Stephen King years to finish this book is something of an inspiration. It is an excellent introduction to the very real world of the Gunslinger, of Jake, and Oy. Apparently inspired by the Lord of the Rings, I think it surpasses even Tolkien in its sheer scale and ambition - If not with this first chapter in the Dark Tower series then certainly as a whole. Anyone who has read Black Book Part 1: The Devil's Blood will know how influential this story can be. Bravo.
Subtle Flavors I'd compare this book to a robust brandy; a slow paced story that's great to savor, but no good if your plans are to rush through and check another one off the list. The style and language are strong, and the characters are as realistic as they are varied.
Awesome Awesome Book One reviewer quipped: "It's a guy thing" Whatever! What, only guys can enjoy a good read? Please.... Well, I am all woman and I LOVED this book! Roland is perhaps one of the most well written characters of the last century. A Flawed Hero...I have waited anxiously for each book and purchased them as soon as they were available.
A fantatick read for people whom are willing. the four books in the dark tour seares will slowly pull you in. you will become a companin of Roland, the most intregueing chaireator that king has yet to create. it is a vertuial gumbo of steven kings books draging you through time space and Dimension. remember it starts slow dont just stop at the first book you wont be disapointed.
Like Hemingway? There is really something great about this. There is a bare bones emphasis on dialogue and scenery that his extremely well done. The characters are very interesting. The major action is de-emphasized. Clearly something for the fiction buff in the long, hot summer, but has something great and beyond just escape fiction in the telling.
Eerie, creepy western with a dash of sci-fi I loved this book. Roland and his persuance of the Man in Black is a very eerie piece of writing and the way King ties it into The Stand(another scary,brilliant piece of his imagination) is creative. He twists the reader's thinking as to whether the story happened in the past, the present or is an apocalyptic vision of the future.
Amazing and very thought provolking I read this on recommendation from a friend. I found it very thought provolking and I can see how each piece of symbolism will take on different attributes with different perspective (at different times in your life). This book is the beginning of a 7 book series. I am continueing Roland's journey through the series. I would highly recommend this book
DEAR GOD! This has got to be one of the most complex stories to which I have ever had the pleasure of being exposed. Mr. King has a mind that I fear for him is twisted and frantic. Always turning and evolving, this book is but a piece of a story that is consuming. If you want to take a literal journey then this is the book for you.
A very Good Book Stephen King at his best! This book captured my attention and started me on the quest for the dark tower. It explores western and science fiction territories. It tells of good and evil and what one will do to reach his goal. The book gives the reader moments of sadness, happiness, and horror. All in all it is a wonderful book.
Needs a great director for movie My third... ok fourth time reading and its like watching a favorite movie and seeing something you missed before. The beginning of an epic tale by Mr king which can make you a fan if you aren't one already. Take a read and enter a world that has moved on and slips further still while Roland quests for the dark tower.
Excellent... A master of storytelling, King's 'The Gunslinger' is a great introduction to the voluminous 'Dark Tower' series. He uses just enough reality to keep us going, but enough fantasy to keep us interested. The later books can bog down a bit just by shear volume, but this one is crisp. A great read for anyone.
Hate Stephen King? Read this book anyway! I won't say much except this. I've never liked Stephen King, I don't like the horror genre either. I've loved the first 4 books in the Dark Tower series. King wrote some gripping stories when he wrote these. If you have avoided King but are considering giving him a chance, then buy this book!
The Man in Black Fled Across the Desert.. And that is how you get hooked into this wonderful series of books. I don't think there is enough space here to gush about how much I love this series. What makes it even better is how the story lines from these books are found in other novels of his... Hearts in Atlantis, Insomnia, and others.
Long days and pleasant nights You don't have to be a Stephen King fan to love this series. This first volume draws you in and binds you to the main character, Roland, and leaves you with so many questions you can't help but move on to the next book. Be ready for a time investment, because this will hook you from start to finish.
One of my favs This is easily one of my favorite series every, and the first book is damn near perfect in eyes. I enjoyed the whole series though, and thought it ended in a way that it should have. The first book is well written, has memorable characters, and is risky. It's not scary, and yet not timid. Enjoy!
Not my Kingly cup of tea. I love King books. But i could not get into this one and will not get the rest in the series. It started off slow. Then got really good at Tull. After that, it really started to drag. I had to force myself to finish it and that is not the kind of book experience i enjoy. When a book is called Gunslinger, I expect someone to be slinging their gun. Not stay in its holster 99% of the time.
finally read it, took only 4 days Friends have been recommending this series for many years now, and I finally started, and finished this first book in a matter of days....couldn't put it down. Can't wait to start reading the next one!
Couldn't put it down This book was fantastic. From the first page of the Dark Tower to the last page of the seventh book, this saga engaged me. Be warned, once you start this series, it'll be very hard to put it down.
Stephan Kings best saga This book was great but you cant just read this one it gets you into tons of king books this book is so cool it even has others after it on the same story including THe drawing of the 3, the waste lands, and wizard and glass there is sure to be more coming. I really recomend this book.
"King's Best Work Yet!" "King leaves his horror genre behind and writes something far better. I lost a lot of sleap reading this book. He makes you wanting more when your done reading. This proves that King can write something extrodinary, if your looking for a good book to read, get this now!"
Advice You have to take this advice, or you will miss out on some of the best writing by Steven King. If you think the Gunslinger is boring, try out the next book, it is well worth it. You wont be sorry. Once you start reading it will consume your life until the book is finished.
First Book Has its ups and downs; the magic wears off for each successive listening, but I have to keep listening because I am addicted to George G's narration, I always have been. Also King's style is unique; I'm sure I will listen to this at least 1,000 more times before I give it up.
Combination between King Arthur and Unforgiven. If you like fantasy, you've got to start the Dark Tower series. The Gunslinger is a short first book which is good because the series is a long one to commit to, so after this one you'll know it's worth it to go on. I'm about to start The Drawing of the Three and I can't wait.
Love it! This first book of the series is a a little bit confusing, but the Dark Tower series is amazing! I loved Lord of the Rings and the other Tolkien books when i read it, but I think nowadays these are my favorite books!
Great The only reason I'm giving this four instead of five stars is because the second one is my favorite of the series. The Gunslinger is an insightful first look into one of the intriguing characters I have ever read about. When I picked it up I didn't know that it was part of a series. When I finished I immediately went out and bought The Dark Tower II, The Drawing of the Three.
Interesting set-up for the rest of the series, but... This was a re-write of King's original book. Despite the edits, an otherwise interesting tail was weighed down by overly-descriptive, adjective-laced narrative. King's youth as a writer shows through.
Great book, just Not King's normal style I'm well behind the curve here as this book came out many years ago. But after seeing it recommended by another author online I decided to pick it up. And I'm hooked! It's not like his other stuff and is more of a science fiction book than the mystery/horror novels by Stephen King. Of course his characters came to life just as well or even better than in some of his past works. I enjoyed it so much I'm now on Drawing of the Three. I say if you like King and also like syfy you should thoroughly enjoy The Gunslinger.
awesome I thought the book was very good and some times i couldnt put it down. I liked that you were mostly in his memorys. I wouldnt advise it to littler kids cause sometimes it gets graphical and i would know cause when i read is the only time i have an imagination.
The Gunslinger I will admit that I am biased, because I love all of Stephen King's work. I came to this series late but once I began I couldn't stop until I had devoured all the books. I love the mash-up of the Old West western and fantasy. The story is enchanting. King is wonderful in the writing of and development of his characters. I can read and re-read these stories again and again.
Hands up for King The Gunslinger was a great book (It did dissapoint me alittle with his talking about earth things and electrictiy(I am a serious fantasy fan)). I just started the Drawing of the Three and it is pretty good. NOt a book to pass up if you are a fantasy fan.
life changing possibly the best and most rediculous book ive ever read. When you finally realize this is going to make no sense and go with it its amazing. I have since gone on to read all 7 books and plan to start over again. I refuse to give away any plot or details
A fantastic blend of several topics into one AWESOME story! This is perhaps the most unique book that I have read in a long time. There is no real "category" that this book can even fall under. Beware: reading this novel will literally suck you into a world where you will want to keep reading about!
The Gunslinger The Dark Tower 1 QofA #12 January 10, 2006 Book Review The Gunslinger The Dark Tower 1 The book The Gunslinger is very exciting. The beginning grabs you into the book itself. The author of this book is Stephen King. The book is about a gunslinger chasing the man in black. A quote from the beginning of the book is "There were fewer now; he had run through them like a mower's scythe." Page 84. In the middle, the gunslinger finds a boy in the desert. Another quote is "Except perhaps, the rode to the tower." Page 155. Leading to the end, " He walked slowly, drunkenly down the rock hill toward where the man in black waited." Page 267. The main characters in the book are merely introduced in the first book of the Dark Tower Series. The gunslinger is a strong man with two guns. The boy is young, strong, and has a strange past. The gunslinger and the boy love each other. The man in black is a man with magic. The story takes place in the future, a weird future. The book's genre is a science fiction. The good things the author did with the book were having very interesting flashbacks. Stephen King also put a lot of details into the book. The book overall was fine. The theme of the book is a fantasy. The Gunslinger is good for adults to read. It has some inappropriate material. The story is like an adventure like The Lord of the Rings, Frodo's part by J.R.R. Tolken. The story has mutants, demons, and sorcerers all in one. The style of writing in the Gunslinger is different than that of the Harry Potter books by J.R. Rowling. Stephen King is more descriptive than Rowling. The language used in the book fits, the metaphors are unique, and the material flows with the story. My opinion about the book was that is was okay. It would be a shrug and a nod. I read the story at my house at night or at day. A lot of parts in the book were grabbing, and some were not. I would give the book The Gunslinger three stars.
The King of Suspense goes epic Being the first book of the seven book series comprising "The Dark Tower", "The Gunslinger" is an interesting, entertaining read. Written by Stephen King with a strong influence by "The Lord of the Rings" and Western films, "The Gunslinger" is a journey into a world similar - yet remarkably different - than our own. The story follows Roland of Gilead - the titular Gunslinger - as he chases the Man in Black. As the story unfolds and develops, the reader gains a bit of an understanding why the cat and mouse chase is taking place. Along the way, Roland befriends a young boy, Jake, who accompanies him on his journey to find the Man in Black. Jake already knows the Man in Black - he has seen him before when he lived in "our" world, before he was "transported" to Roland's. The story and writing itself is very good - Stephen King is an excellent writer. With the opening line "The Man in Black fled across the desert, and the Gunslinger followed", how can a reader not be interested enough to at least learn more about the story? It is a great introduction and first piece to what is hopefully a great series (albeit very long). The one gripe is that sometimes it feels as if King is trying a little too hard to make his story epic - which he was intent upon doing from the beginning. His goal was to create an epic, and at places his writing conveys the idea that he is really, really, really trying to make it become an epic, rather than it becoming an epic on its own. Other than that, it is an excellent fantasy read - which deviates from King's traditional genre(s) - with some provocative writing. Particularly interesting and thought provoking is the conversation with the Man in Black about size (pages 220-223 in the hardcover edition). If you're a fan of King and are looking to read more of his works, this is one that should be high on the list. If you aren't a fan or inexperienced with King and are looking to read a work or two of his, this should be very high on the list. If you're a fan of fantasy or science fiction, this should be high on the list. All in all, this is a great book, full of interesting ideas and written with a different - yet highly inspired - style.
Unique and High-Quality Saga Beginning The first installment of Stephen King's "Dark Tower" saga takes place on a pseudo-old-western world of ghost towns and scattered settlements and vast, encroaching deserts, where saloon pianos play Beatles songs and other out-of-place (and time) elements keep creeping in, on a world apparantly descended from a much more advanced civilization. An alternate world that apparantly faced some kind of global catastrophe and somehow re-emerged as a re-creation of the American Old West should come off very campy, but as you get into the book you quickly realize that it's not coming off that way at all, and the juxtaposition of believability on what should be absurdity results in an unnerving air, perhaps suggesting the breaking down of what we think of as reality, or the threads of fate knotted up in kinks. The heroes of the book are a ruthless gunslinger named Roland (constantly in pursuit of a mysterious 'man in black') and a boy named Jake from 'our' world who's somehow crossed over into this dessicated husk of a post-apocalyptic reality. There are a lot of nasty, often detestable characters in here, many of them nominally on the side of good. Included in this, though not to the extent of some of the others, is the title Gunslinger. I usually don't like the 'selfish anti-hero' role, the supposed good guy who's willing to mow down anyone in his way and sacrifice anything or anybody in pursuit of their own purportedly noble goal, but in here it works differently. The main reason way, I think, is you see the character starting not just to question his own actions, but really just becoming aware for the first time of just how far he repeatedly goes to assure the success of his quest. There's an impending sense that as the book goes along he's going to eventually come to a realization of how brutal he truly is, but that by then it may be too late, and also a catch-22 sense that even if he does decide he wants to stop or change, the quest, once its true nature is revealed, may for once actually be too important - on a cosmic scale - to ever stop. Roland seems to begin questioning his own methods primarily through the influence of Jake, whose complete innocence in all this seems to present almost unknown concepts to the Gunslinger. A really, really good and unique spin on the whole philosophical question of how much 'necesary' evil is justified to stop a presumably greater evil. It's also a really good story, a successful mixing of the western, horror, and fantasy genres, and some of the most memorably written passages King has ever done. Highly recommended.
It would be great even on its own.... "The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed." There's really not much more you need to know about this story except what's right up there. That's the essence of the whole thing - a chase. A man in black, who has obviously done something terrible, and a gunslinger, who is obviously going to set things right. If, by "set right," you mean "kill a whole lot of people," then you're pretty much on target. This is the beginning of Stephen King's Dark Tower series, a story told in seven volumes that manages to be the lynchpin for all the worlds that he has created. It's a story that was 22 years in the writing, and almost never got finished. It's an epic story, all about the endless quest for the Dark Tower, the center of all reality, the axle upon which the wheels of creation move. Roland, the gunslinger, is hunting for this tower. He wants it more than anything in the world. He has lost everything in pursuit of this tower - his friends, his family, his world - and yet he pressed on. The man in black has information for him, can set his path towards his goal. If only Roland can catch him. On his way to the man in black, Roland finds a small town taken over by a mad preacher woman, a sympathetic hermit, and a boy who doesn't look like he's terribly local to this world. All of them help point the way to the man in black, and none of them make it to the end with Roland. Even he is unprepared for the terrifying reality that awaits him when he and the man in black finally have their palaver.... There truly is something magical about this book. Even if there were no other Dark Tower books, it would stand out as a good story, well told. Part of this is its deceptive simplicity - moving from point A to point B, with only a few flashbacks to fill in the backstory. Well, quite a lot of flashbacks, actually, seeing as how King did set this story in a featureless desert with a singular protagonist, and there's only so much you can work with without dipping into the well of the past from time to time. The glimpses of Roland's past that we get to see are tantalizing - they tell of a rich and cultured world that is nonetheless hard and merciless. The gunslingers are all that stand between civilization and chaos, and there are precious few of them left. Roland and his friends know they may be the last of their kind, but that doesn't deter them from pursuing their guns and growing up to honor their fathers. The fact that we know from the beginning that they all fail just makes it all the more poignant to watch them try. It's hard to talk about this book without trying to talk about the rest of the series, and it's even harder to convey the feeling of reading it when the series was still ongoing. My father, a huge Stephen King fan, had these books when I was a kid, and I eventually got into them, and was - like so many others - immeasurably frustrated by the pace at which King was writing them. I finished this book, which does not necessarily have a happy - or easy-to-understand - ending, and I wanted more. I wanted to know what Roland was going to do now that he'd had his palaver with the man in black, and I wanted to know if he would ever find the Dark Tower. Whom would he enlist in his quest, as the oracle had suggested? Whom else would he sacrifice, as he did young Jake? Speaking of which, the relationship between Roland and Jake is an interesting one, especially as I got older and re-read it. When I first read the book, I was probably around Jake's age - eleven years old [1]. Reading Jake's story of how he came to Roland's world was horrifying enough, but to see how their relationship would eventually end was even worse. The idea that there might be something more important to, say, my parents [2] than I was - well, that was horrifying. To think that a purpose might exist for which they would let me fall to my death.... That's not the kind of thing an eleven year-old boy wants to think about. From the point of view of an older person, a grown man, I found something uncomfortable about their relationship. The bond that formed between man and boy was instant, and intense, and having grown up in a culture where a strange man being that friendly to a young boy would be automatically colored with the taint of pedophilia, well, I had to work a little harder to stay in Roland's head. The fact that I know that wasn't where King was going with the relationship helps a little, but every reader brings his or her hang-ups along when they read and some of mine are a little more persistent than others. I'm sure any psychologist who needs to put a down payment on a yacht would be happy to help me work on it. All in all, it's an excellent beginning. What follows is a massive tale, a great quest that spans time and space and reality, culminating in Roland's final understanding of who he is and why he exists. Not all of it is as good as this book, but it's still worth reading, I say ya true. So put on your good boots, don't forget your hat and horn and donkey. It's a long trip to the end.... ------------------------------------------- "This is not the beginning but the beginning's end. You'd do well to remember that... but you never do." - The Man in Black ------------------------------------------- [1] This is another example of the Eleven Year-Old Boy Rule: if you have a major character in your book who is not an adult, chances are that it will be an eleven year-old boy. King is a master of this. [2] Because if Roland isn't a father-substitute then I don't know who is.

A somewhat vague beginning to a promising epic At this point in time, the first five books of Stephen King's Dark Tower series have been released. I laid my eyes on the newest edition, Wolves of the Calla, this past weekend while at Waldenbooks. Having read The Dark Tower I: The Gunslinger about two months ago, I finally decided to review it since my trip to the bookstore revitalized the immense interest in me to read The Dark Tower series and find out just how the hell things will turn out. We know now that the series will contain seven books with the subtitle of the final installment identical to the title. The final edition will be The Dark Tower VII: The Dark Tower and, by the way things have been building up in the plot of the story, I can say that I believe that Part VII will be somewhat of a collaboration of King's past works and most famous villains put into one single novel. This would seem like a good book for an author to retire on after publishing, but I pray King keeps writing because the world of books wouldn't be the same without him. Most of the reviews I've read on The Gunslinger while surfing the web have been coupled with mixed feelings on its plot and the way the direction of the story is going to be weaved. I will admit it IS vague, but I found myself extremely drawn into its fantasy-like plot blended with good old-fashioned macabre horror written in the familiar Stephen King style. The reviews I read on it before reading probably helped me to expect a little confusion and gaps in explanation. There are many here and there but just the drive to find out what's going to happen is enough to keep you coming back for more. Within the first few pages, we are immediately launched into an unknown world with a setting that readers could deliberate on for hours. It appears to have the makes of a good Western but is mixed with several other genres, including horror, fantasy, and action. This place that our imaginations are taken into is referred to as "the world that has moved on." It doesn't seem to be Earth in the 1880's, as some might predict, because of the unfamiliar surroundings. It doesn't appear to contain the makeup for any distinct place, so we're left with our wild minds to fill in the gaps. In this world we meet a man who is referred to as the Gunslinger for the first 2/3 of the book until we discover his name is Roland. He is a gunslinger and an expert at that, who is the last of his people in this large, lonely desert landscape. His only goal, we discover, is to find and catch the elusive "man in black." This man in black seems to be a demonic fiend that guards a certain sector of the Dark Tower, the entire saga's focal point. Clues from within Roland's dark, intricate mind and context from within the story help us to determine that the Dark Tower is the place where all time and space will meet. The place at the very edge of the universe where all things come to an end. This changes our perspective on Roland's world, making us think that maybe he resides in an alternate timeline. Who knows? On his journey, Roland meets a man named Brown and, within his company, he tells the man a tale of his quest through the desert Tull, his experiences with his mistress Alice in a small village, and his exciting final battle with the unfriendly townspeople. This battle, which occurs about 30-40 pages into this short 216-page prologue, whets our appetite for more wild, gun-toting action. Sadly, this is probably the most exciting part of The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger. Back in real time, Roland wanders through the desert and collapses right before meeting a 12-year-old boy named Jake. Roland reads his mind and, ironically as it seems, the boy is from New York City (a place Roland has no knowledge of) where he was pushed out into the street one morning by the sinister man in black and killed under the wheels of a Cadillac. It appears he's been reborn into Roland's world. More clues suggest that this place could be an Afterlife of sorts. We may not find the answers to any of these need-to-know questions until Part VII. I plan to stick with it and hope that King's amazing writing will keep me intrigued. The way I perceive this book may be different than others, but my feelings are that King did his best to develop a prologue for his massive tale that is sure to be somewhere in the 3000-page range. He wrote The Gunslinger the best way he could in that he didn't reveal much about the setting, the main character Roland, or the Dark Tower that he seeks (somewhat of a letdown) but he did give us a satisfying introduction to what promises to be a solid, entertaining masterpiece in its completed form.

A Mysterious Anachronistic Mystery (Spoiler Free Review) A mysterious Gunslinger tracks a mysterious Wizard through a mysterious barren wasteland. Story: The story reminded me of the first season of LOST. It has all of the pieces of a familiar world, but the pieces don't quite fit together. The story begins with a Gunslinger from the old west, tracking a wizard dressed in black. The Gunslinger, named Roland, is on a single minded quest to kill the wizard. The quest takes him through a mysterious world that is a combination of the mid-west and the old west. At times the characters seem alive, dead, undead, or somewhere in between. The book doesn't give a lot of answers, but it's entertaining trying to figure out what is going on as you put the pieces together in your head. Writing Style: This is a page turner. The Chapters are broken down into scenes that last 2-5 pages and the book is less than 300 pages overall. The sentence structure is simple and the scenes are set with imagery. "The mountains dreamed in the background." If you thought, "Huh? Mountains don't have dreams." This isn't the book for you. But if you had an image in your mind of distant mountains barely visible through a haze of shimmering heat, then you should enjoy this. The story has a few flashbacks which answer some of the mysterious questions about the characters, but these flashbacks do break the momentum of the story. You just get glimpses of pieces, with no real answers. Characters: Roland is a gunslinger from the Old West. He's driven nearly to the point of madness. The Wizard has magic powers and seems to know a lot more than he's telling. There are a host of other characters who seem to be from different time periods. Because the book is so short, and there is so much mystery, the characters feel a bit light. Action: There is some gunslinging in the book and it's quite violent. Bullets do really bad things to a body. Maturity: There are sex scenes, violence, gore, horror, language, and complex situations. Kids should NOT read this book! Overall: The book does a good job at building a sense of mystery. The plot is not overly complex. The characters are not complex. But this is a page turner. If you found yourself addicted to Season 1 of LOST, and you were itching to find out what happened next, you will blow right through this book. Overall, the story is pretty light, but it is a good intro to a fantasy series.
Gunslinger review Stephen King published his first novel, Carrie, in 1973. This started the beginnings of an unstoppable career, which today, includes over 150 published works, over 40 movies, and most recently a series of seven comic books based on the Dark Tower series. Stephen King was inspired to write the Dark Tower series after reading a poem written in 1855 by Robert Browning called Childe Roland and by the spaghetti western movies such as, "The Good, the Bad, the Ugly." This first book is considerably shorter than all six of the rest of the books in the series, but sets the stage for the ride of a lifetime. The opening line, "The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed." was written while he was an undergraduate in college. This first sentence traversed readers into an epic saga that has taken over twenty years to journey through. The Dark Tower series is a grand tale of good (Roland) vs. evil (Crimson King). This is a tale has been told since the beginning of time since the Bible and in recent works such as the Lord of the Rings series by J.R.R. Tolkien and the Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling. All these stories tell the epic battles of courageous heroes fighting incredible odds to save humanity from evil, (respectively the Jesus vs. Devil, Frodo vs. Saroun, and Harry vs. Lord Voldemort). The Dark Tower series is so entwined in Stephen King's writings that references, subtle and not so subtle, to the Dark Tower are found in sixteen of his other works, including It, The Stand, and Bag of Bones. I would recommend this book and Dark Tower series to young adult readers ages thirteen and up and to any one who is entranced by epic battles of good vs. evil. After you start the journey of reading the Dark Tower series, I would also recommend sidetracking and reading all the related relevant works to the Dark Tower series to help enhance your adventure while following Roland on his quest to save the Tower and humanity.
QofA#12 QofA #12 January 10, 2006 Book Review The Gunslinger The Dark Tower 1 The book The Gunslinger is very exciting. The beginning grabs you into the book itself. The author of this book is Stephen King. The book is about a gunslinger chasing the man in black. A quote from the beginning of the book is "There were fewer now; he had run through them like a mower's scythe." Page 84. In the middle, the gunslinger finds a boy in the desert. Another quote is "Except perhaps, the rode to the tower." Page 155. Leading to the end, " He walked slowly, drunkenly down the rock hill toward where the man in black waited." Page 267. The main characters in the book are merely introduced in the first book of the Dark Tower Series. The gunslinger is a strong man with two guns. The boy is young, strong, and has a strange past. The gunslinger and the boy love each other. The man in black is a man with magic. The story takes place in the future, a weird future. The book's genre is a science fiction. The good things the author did with the book were having very interesting flashbacks. Stephen King also put a lot of details into the book. The book overall was fine. The theme of the book is a fantasy. The Gunslinger is good for adults to read. It has some inappropriate material. The story is like an adventure like The Lord of the Rings, Frodo's part by J.R.R. Tolken. The story has mutants, demons, and sorcerers all in one. The style of writing in the Gunslinger is different than that of the Harry Potter books by J.R. Rowling. Stephen King is more descriptive than Rowling. The language used in the book fits, the metaphors are unique, and the material flows with the story. My opinion about the book was that is was okay. It would be a shrug and a nod. I read the story at my house at night or at day. A lot of parts in the book were grabbing, and some were not. I would give the book The Gunslinger three stars.
A perfect suspended beginning of a long series This is the first volume of the Dark Tower series. The main hero, the gunslinger, is nearly dead on a beach, attacked by some monster crabs or lobsters, dying of some kind of fever in a world that is under our own world. This gunslinger has to cross a door somewhere to be able to find, in our world, the drugs that will save him, but also to have the idea of building the team he will need to go to that Dark Tower that should represent the resurrection of his world, the epiphany of our world. So it is the beginning of the trip across some vast country toward this tower, with some crossings into our world to get the antibiotic he needs and to discover the people he will need on his trip. This underworld is not explained, except that it lies under our world. We don't know why the hero is in the situation he is in at the beginning of the novel. We don't really know why he has that strange mission to go to the Dark Tower, to save his world. We do not know who he is and what he was in that apparently ruined world. This first volume just builds up the character and is an excellent appetizer that will make us feel famished for the next volumes. We must note we find the same pattern in The Talisman by Stephen King and Peter Straub, a pattern that was to be found too in The Eyes of the Dragon : a ruined world lies under our own world and our own world's survival depends on the saving of this underlying world. We can also compare this book with IT and some other books, where the underworld is the haunt and home of some monster that lives upon our world by vampiristically drawing its food or vital energy from our world. This duality of Stephen King's imaginary world is fundamental in his fiction. The point is that in the present book, this underlying world is not really feeding on our world, though what happens in it is both caused by what happens in ours and determines what will happen in ours.

so good i read it in one day this is a great book i have read the 1st 4 of these books and this one is the best this,in a way,tells the whole story if you read the book and read the other 3 you should read this one again although the smallest it is the most important of the 4
Now on book three Well obviously I enjoyed it because I'm now on book three. Like millions of others I've read lots of King's novels, but I had never heard of this serial work. I was looking for a 'summer read' and this was recommended by a friend. Now, I'm enjoying this page turner.
This was a boring read for me but then I wasn't impressed with ... This was a boring read for me but then I wasn't impressed with the Good, Bad and the Ugly either. I had decided if the second book didn't grab me I would stop reading the series. The second book was a good read and after that I finished the series with no regrets. Will now remember and cherish Roland and his Ka-Tet. Of course Oye was my favorite.
King's second version As King points out in the foreword of this book, it is a rare opportunity for the author to get second chance on previously written book - a chance to glance back, and revise the work that has been done over 20 years ago. Of course, looking at the success of this book, it seems that King wouldn't had to do it. I'm glad that he did so regardless. Altough the original version (if you may) was not the best book in the series, it layed a good foundation for the following books to be built on. This revised version does it even better. King have had the chance to weed out the unneccessarities such as excessive adjectives (as he self points out), and even fix few conflicts with the following books. That makes this second version more readable - and in my opinion plain better. I would see this book as a mood setter which, being very mystic, cannot be the most easiest book to read. King does not give away much in this one, merely paints the surroundings and motives for the story to come. So altough this book might not make you fall in love with this story, be assured that the following books will. As King him self has said: "A long novel is like a marriage, a short story is like a kiss. They're different, but both have thier points.". This book is like a wedding, a start of something pretty beautiful, and you would be a fool to not give it a chance. You probably at this point, have figured out where I stand with Dark Tower, but just to be on the safe side: I think this is definitely one of the best saga's written until today, and absolutely worth of reading. The only reason why this book does not get all 5 stars from me is because some of the following books in Dark Tower series are even better. So, join Roland on his amazing quest for the Tower - you won't be disappointed.
Not as impressed as others The best part of this book for me is Stephen King's Introduction and forward. He talks about what it was like to be a young writer composing The Gunslinger. He writes about the changes he made to the book in this revised and expanded edition. Not surprisingly, the purists have lambasted this version, which is probably good for King and his publishers, since this negative attention has made me (and presumably many other first time readers of the Dark Tower series) want to read the original rendering. The story itself is ok, but for me, not great. It is in the fantasy (some call it science fiction, but I don't see the science) genre', but I still think King's strength is in horror. I realize this was King's start in the business and in some sense his life long project since it took him many years to complete the entire series. Therefore, to be critical of this work, is to be critical of Stephen King as a whole. Personally, I find this argument fallible, as I am a huge fan of much of King's work. This book just seems to be a frustratingly futile attempt of one man (the gunslinger) to find his purpose in life. His chase of the man in black leads only to an anti-climatic meeting in the end, especially in light of the very famous opening quote, "The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed". One aspect of this novel which is appealing is the development of the relationship between the gunslinger and the boy. The boy deserves much attention, since he gives the book something of an edge by inserting a scared, unsure boy to contrast the placid, cold gunslinger. This relationship also seems important in a narrative sense as it gives King reason to flashback to the gunslinger's own childhood. Whether these flashbacks prove important in later books in the series, I do not know. These unsatisfying resolutions and unknowns may give way to a larger truth, that is, King really wanted the Dark Tower series to read as one complete book. To give a somewhat poor review to a book before reading the entire series may be a bit like reviewing a book after reading only one chapter. I reserve the right to rethink this book (and the series as a whole) as I read further.
excellent i can personally say that, despite my wide collection, this is simply the best stephen king book ive ever read. this fact is in no way biased by the fact that i happened to be reading The Girl Who loved Tom Gorden about the same time
The Beginning of an Epic Adventure The Gunslinger has always been my favorite beginning to a series. I have read and re-read this book many times and it still brings me goose bumps knowing what is ahead of me. Read this book. Read it again and again.
An absolutely wonderful read! Stephen King takes you to another world...a world of fantasy where all technology as disappeared. A world where a elite grouo of fighters called the gunslingers keep all that is good. This book is hard to put down and a must read.
Stephen King delivers once again. Fast paced, engaging, intriguing, profound. This "other-worldly" tale, taking inspiration from the mystical and the Wild West, will be sure to captivate its reader. Looking forward to starting the next volume.
You have to read the whole series When I read this book, I actually thought that it was written by "another" Stephen King....someone that was using Steve's name to capitalize on his popularity. After reading the series, I am amazed by how it all comes together.
Stubbornness does give you strength Would've given4 and a half! Writing styles very different took alittle while to get used to. Some ideas a little hard to grasp?... But like I said first time reading him definetly gonna read the whole series!!
A Preview of Nightmares to Follow Reviewing "The Gunslinger" is like reviewing a more typical novel after reading only the first chapter. And as the first of King's seven-volume "Dark Tower" epic, it does read much more as an introduction than as a standalone novel. But these disclaimers not withstanding, "Gunslinger" is powerful fiction, giving the reader a glimpse into the powerful and twisted imagination that is uniquely Stephen King's, effectively setting the hook for much more to come. A little bit Star War's Jedi Knight, a little bit Sergio Leone's "Man without a Name", King's Roland of Gilead, the last of an ancient warrior sect, pursues the mysterious and malevolent "man in black" across a desert wasteland. In "Gunslinger", time and place are but vague concepts surely to be gradually unveiled as the series continues. Through a combination of events that unwind in Roland's pursuit, and recollections from his Spartan-like childhood and early friendships and love, readers of King's later works - The Stand, Black House, and many more - will recognize in "Gunslinger" familiar themes. Familiar also are King's razor-sharp writing skills, layering both characters and settings grain-by-grain across a bleak and malignant landscape in King's unmistakable style. Like a well-done movie trailer, "The Gunslinger" is a masterful setup to what is certainly to be the poignant and suspenseful narrative of "The Dark Tower" that will follow. Few can match King's abilities for telling a story; this is the beginning of what is arguable his magnum opus.
Roland of Gilead! The Gunslinger is a foot into the door to a crowning achievement of Mr. King's Dark Tower series. The imagination behind the narrative is without bounds, and the story leaps from one twist to another. A worthy read.
Don't waste your time... I just hated nearly every moment of it. It legitimately put me to sleep at times but I always finish a book. The writing was confusing and all of the stories were so boring. Even when something exciting happened, it lasted for a page and then it was back to boring. There were times when a conversation was happening but you cant tell who the heck is talking... I hear these reviews of "Oh the first book was bad but the rest of the series is great", I will never continue on to reading the second book. So disappointing..
Very good story. I just finished this. It is great. I have both versions of this book at my house now. King's writting style keeps you going. I will read the next three sequel books next and then I will review those too. Recomended.
deep allegorical fantasy Roland Deschain of Gilead knows he is obsessed over finding the Dark Tower, but does not care. He will follow the Man in Black wherever he goes and for how long it takes even into eternity until he catches this person, if he is a person, and force him to reveal the locale of the Dark Tower. If others die at his hands after meeting the Gunslinger so be it. Currently he tracks his prey across a desert stopping at a way station where he meets a child whom he thought at first was his target, albeit two feet shorter. The kid is John "Jake" Chambers from 1977 New York City wherever in hell that place is. Shockingly to the solitary Deschain, instead of his usual killing or just another soul left behind, Roland allows Jake to accompany him on his trek towards the mountains, the Man in Black, and ultimately the Black Tower. This is somewhat of a reprint, but Stephen King has added back in edited out sections and rewritten some passages. The story line retains the strange, deep allegorical fantasy reminiscent of the cult movie El Topo with less gore and Michael Whelans' drawings add to that overall eerie feeling. The desert looms so vast and is so critical to the plot that the audience will see it as a character unto itself. The other key players fit in this TS Eliot Wasteland meets the Stand environs. Fans of the horror master and those who appreciate a powerful parable fantasy will join the Gunslinger and Jake on their quest. Harriet Klausner
What a Departure for King The Dark Tower story is the one tale Stephen King said he always wanted to tell. Well, it certainly didn't disappoint, but the time interval between books made it a little hard to be faithful to the series. Roland is a distant relative to the round table and King Arthur, I believe. He is a knight in a sense, in a futuristic world where the champions of the old west have regained prominence as the "jedi knights" of King's world. Tutored since birth and tested at the gunslinger's bidding, these supermen with pistols have no equal in the world where they are born. Roland's quest throughout the series is to find the Dark Tower, and I believe, the man who messed with his family. He takes a roundabout way, showing his prowess with all aspects of wielding a six-gun, as he winds his way through an endless desert in search of his goal. He finally passes through the great expanse and finds himself facing a giant ocean, with some very strange creatures as his welcoming committee. I loved this story, and Roland is a great character. I went on to read books two, three and four, but stopped there. I waited years for the ensuing books to come out, and when they finally did I felt rather betrayed. I haven't read the Wolves of Calla yet, but as I said, up to that point the story is magnificent. The Gunslinger definitely puts the hook in you, you won't want to stop there, especially with the doors on beach in the next novels - YIKES!

Gunslinger Gunslinger is the first book of King's that I have read, but I have delved into Fantasy style books for a long time. King's incredible twist on the fantasy genre made for a book that was very hard to put down.
The Dark Tower Loved It! Recommend this book to anyone looking for an action type story setting, and to have entertainment from start to finish. This book makes you want more every chapter, which is why it is such a fun book to read. In the desolate world portrayed throughout the book, you can frightenly make an eerie comparison to ours. Although it contains a rather boring, almost confusing beginning, because of who he meets, and all he talks to, readers who elect to read on are really amazed by how great and entertaining this book really is. The line "The man in black fled across the desert and the gunslinger followed," clearly sums up the whole plot of the story, and the gunslinger's motivation. He is willing to sacrifice all, even his own life, to find the man in black. Through meeting many people along his journey in this story, one can have a peak at his past. Several people that he meets are really just traps left by the man in black to avoid the gunslinger. The Gunslinger comes across as a very rugged, adventureous kind of man, who loves to kill, so to speak. Although he makes some friends along his journey, he sacrifices them to find the Man in Black. The Man in Black is a very mischevious character, who is greatly determined to escape Roland, the gunslinger, by setting traps for him... A very exciting and adventureous book. My kind of book! Recommend it to anyone... This book was recommended to me by the very Chase Kildgore himself.
Some advice for first timer's on the Gunslinger To the folks having problems getting through this novel, skip it and go read the second one first. The second book will actually get you to want to read the first novel. I know this makes no sense, but trust me on this.
I Didn't Hate It Based on other things I've read by King and the hype I'd received from aquaintances, I was looking forward to the read. It didn't live up to the hype, and I certainly wasn't sucked into the saga sufficiently to read the next one in the series.
Interesting and unique story line. I enjoyed the coloful characters and the isolated world in which Roland lived. Interesting corrolation between the past world that we know and the world to come which shows itself as a combination of the old west and the kingdoms of times past.
An Imperfect Start to an Epic Series "Childe Roland to the dark tower came ..." Yes, but not for awhile. He started in this book, originally written (or at least conceived) more than thirty years ago. Only in the last year has the final installment hit. Newcomers won't have to wait to get there, but they will have to make it through the clunky bits--including this book--to arrive at the tower themselves. Stephen King's broken world of western mythos, magic, and gloomy terror begins with the pursuit of a "man in black." The pursuer is Roland, who we meet as a sort-of Mad Max/Aragorn character combination. And he is nothing if not determined. "The Gunslinger" will kill the wicked, sacrifice the good, and dirty his soul to attain his goal. What it's all about doesn't really come clear in this book. And I'm not saying it should, but at the time that I read it, Stephen King freely admitted that he wasn't entirely sure himself. That, plus the years spent on-and-off this cult bit of literary history, makes for some disjointed, occasionally boring writing. Having said that, it's well worth the reading, not only for its moments of horrific brilliance--not for nothing is he called "gunslinger," as we learn in an early, blood-drenched western-style massacre--but also because this modest tome sets up one of King's finest works. But that's the next book ... (This review has been posted by Marcus Damanda, author of the vampire novel "Teeth: A Horror Fantasy.")
Good start of the series Being a constant Stephen King fan, I have not really paid much attention to this series over the years. But decided when I got the Kindle to jump in. It seems to be quite a story, fasinating, scary, and even thought provoking. I am very happy with this book and have started the next. But I know that Stepehn King will not disappoint.
Just to prove how much I loved this book... ...I'll tell you my story about what happened to me. I bought this book recently, and read the first part of it, and was bored. Then a friend of mine told me about the subject matter of the later parts of the book, and I was passionate to read it. So today, April 11, 2000, I began reading it at around 5:30 in the morning and finished it at 6:30 at night. I read the last few pages with shallow breaths and wide eyes, and when I was done, I put it down and took a deep breath. What a way of living! I am amazed. I have previously read Cycle of the Werewolf, The Green Mile, and Desperation (as well as many short stories in Night Shift, Skeleton Crew, and Nightmares and Dreamscapes), but none of these amount to the incredible power that Stephen King can put into his work. For those of you who think King is an all-out horror writer, THINK AGAIN! These books are... Something else. Not to give anything away, but due to the subject matter, they may make some people think that they are fantasy. After reading just the first one, though, you may think otherwise. I have a whole new way of looking at life now. By the time many people read this review, I will be deeply into The Dark Tower II: The Drawing of the Three. Soon enough I will be reading III, then IV, and the three more to come! Stephen King, you are incredible. Simply put, this book ROCKS!
Couldn't do it Got about 130 pages in. Just couldn't do. Too poorly written. Too hard to follow. Maybe I'm just missing something, or my copy is some kind of misprint. But I hit a wall where the book went from slow but interesting, to incoherent jumps in settings and characters. Maybe it's an unexplained flashback or dream sequence? I'll never know....
Got a chance to reread this again recently... ...and remembered why I liked it so much. Such a gritty, realistic intro to a unique and yet weirdly believable world. I definitely need to reread this series, although I remember being somewhat disappointed as the books progressed. Still one of the best fantasy worlds out there, and Roland is a fantastic character.
Epic yet mysterious Let me begin by stating I did enjoy this book very much. Despite the surreal behavior of certain (if not all) the characters, the novel did not seem like science fiction. Instead, it was very earthly, to say the least. Many themes are examined throughout the novel. Religion, good vs. evil, a greater being, truth, the quest for existence, and love are just some of the themes in King's surprising first novel. The gunslinger is a mysterious character, and yet somehow he is more than capable of loving. The Dark Tower promises to become an American classic. I do, however, have some problems with how King wrote the novel. The book drags at times, and although is relatively short, it seems to take a long time to get through some parts. In addition, it is incredibly easy to become confused at any philosophical revelation in the novel. King leaves many things unexplained at the conclusion of his book (I will not mention what these things are so that others won't use these as excuses for not reading this strange yet fantastic novel). I will finish with this: The Dark Tower 1 - The Gunslinger is unlike any other Steven King novel I have ever read. I felt at times that I was even reading Faulkner's As I Lay Dying. This novel, however, is one of a kind and a must read for all of King's fans.
Very addictive series I read this series almost twenty years ago when I believe there was four books. Three weeks ago I decided to read them again. I just finished the fourth book! This has to be Stephen King's best work. It takes you on the Gunslinger's group to the Dark Tower
Very good introduction to series! Interesting and fun. Not my usual genre, but it was so strange and quirky that I couldn't put it down. The characters are complex and it's tough to describe if I ended up loving or hating them. Just look at this book as an introduction to Book 2, The Drawing of the Three! I can't put it down!!!
Greatest Story ever told The Gunslinger is the beginning book in the Dark Tower series, in my opinion, the greatest story ever told. The narration adds even more character and imagery to an already awesome tale of a strange character in a strange land on a quest that ulimately speaks to the largest unanswered questions we all have. Enjoy the listen.
No Original Version Available I realized when I purchased this that it was a revised edition but the story and characters are different from the original, I for one am going old school and getting it in paperback.
The only thing Stephen King has written that I like! I grew up reading alot of Stevie's old horror books and even back then I found them goofy and badly written. When I was a freshman in high school I needed something to read during the finals. Around that time, The Wastelands had just come out. I took a chance and grabbed the paperback version of The Gunslinger. I was blown away by what I read! I devoured the first book in one day and I had to buy the next two installments. One of the things I really like about this book is how the world of the Dark Tower brings desperate elements together. From westerns to old English knights of the roundtable. Even eastern religion and philosophy are covered in this series and are apart of Roland's world. String that together with King's renowned ability for characterization and you have a true masterpiece of fantasy fiction. I thought Stephen King was a bad writer, but through this series I realized how wrong I was. The entire series is a tribute to all things horror and fantasy and fiction in general. The series gets much better after this first volume, but it was this book that drew me in. I can't comment on the revised material. I myself am against revising the old content. All I know is if you love fiction and fantasy you can't do much better than this book.
This was the second time around for me on this ... This was the second time around for me on this book, it was totally different then the first time which I found interesting. Now am reading Pt 2 to continue my journey of the tower.
Love @ 1st read Like many of his other works...this book is no different in that it satisfies the need for adventure. I love it & again like many of his other works I will read it over & over again.
The Journey for the Tower Begins... "The Gunslinger," alias "Dark Tower I," is not really what you'd expect from a Stephen King book. Nevertheless, it's a fantasic read and well worth the time. But beware that, like Roland, once you get started, there's no turning back. "The Gunslinger" takes place in a world that has "moved on," desolate and worn down. We follow the journey of Roland, the last Gunslinger, as he attempts to catch the elusive man in black and complete his quest for the Dark Tower. This chapter of the Tolkien-esque quest is about 300 pages in length, the shortest of all the "Dark Tower" books, and acts as the warm-up before the workout. Like most books, it's a little slow out of the gate, but once the gunslinger hits Tull, the rest of the story takes off. If you're a fan of King's or of epic journeys, I recommend "The Gunslinger." The entire work is seven books long, so I would only start if you're committed for the long haul. But reading this and all the "Dark Tower" novels are made fun by King's use of language. I could barely finish "Lord of the Rings" because of its language, but I breezed through "Gunslinger," partially because the story became so engrossing that I couldn't put the book down. So go forth and enjoy. There's a lot to look forward to.
Revisit the journey I read this book and the entire The Dark Tower series as a young adult and man. It was really awesome to revisit it as an adult. It didn't lose any of its magic! Great read, again!
Great read! I read this as a teenager many years ago. I decided to dive back into The Dark Tower after finding out it was going to be made into a movie. I will say that after reading this
The Gunslinger This is one series by Steven King that I simply love. I have collected all the books to the series twice now, and have read it at least 5 times and am happy to get the latest in the series. It simply put: The book gets into your head and you cant get it out til your done reading it!!!! I love it!!!!
Review I have read the series before, but it's been awhile. I'm rereading it now before the first movie is released in Feb 2017. So many insights here now that I know how it ends!
King does it again! I've read this book many times and will never get tired of it. This was my first time listening to the audiobook though and it was almost better than reading it on my own. Actually hearing the demands of this destitute world being placed upon Roland's shoulders was quite intense. King did an amazing job in creating this world. Most novels/series that go back and forth between our world and the created world focus mainly on the here and now. King focuses on his world and brings in aspects of ours. It's refreshing to see things switched up a bit. If you don't know me, I should probably tell you now that Stephen King has and always will be my favorite author. The first novel I ever read was The Stand when I was seven and haven't looked back since. It's intriguing how that book actually ties into this series and so many other books of his. And with that, I'd like to say 'thankee sai' for writing your books for so many years and keeping me entertained! Also, if you really enjoy Stephen King's work and really liked this book too, check out the graphic novels. They are quite impressive... Courtney Conant Author of The Blood Moon of Winter (Land of Makayra (Volume 1))
Best part of the entire series... It slows down at the end of the series of books, but early on, The Gunslinger itself is amazing, it really draws you into this other world and the characters within it.
The Best book He ever wrote!!!!!!! I first came across Sai King when i was breaking up with a girlfriend in the late 80's. She gave me the book as a goodbye present and i almost threw the book away. A year later I came across the book in my library and gave it a read. I was hooked! i read every page over and over and used markers to outline things. I once wrote a college paper on it and it was my first A in school history. I thought i would never see the story again and felt sad. then they started coming out. one by one and i was hooked all over again. I am now married, with an 8 year old son and I still treasure these books above all others! they will be read and re-read forever. and when my son is old enough he will get his own set to enjoy. He loves the lord of the rings and Narnia so i think the dark tower book should be right up his alley. These books are legend and will stand long after we are all gone! 30-40-50 years from now people will still be reading these and college lit clases will have them as thier required reading. i cannot say enough about them and only wish there were more books to tell the story
The First Step In answer to some of the previous negative reviews, let me just state that this book is by no means a "stand alone" work. While one can read this novel and enjoy it just the same, there will be some questions left unanswered. This was the author's intent; "The Gunslinger" is Book 1 in a series that will eventually span to 7, the series being finished a year from now. The questions and difficulties people might encounter by reading "The Gunslinger" are answered in full as the series progresses down the line. As an avid fan of King's, I do not hesitate to call "The Gunslinger" and the rest of The Dark Tower series his finest contribution to popular fiction. This is my "Lord of the Rings," since I began reading the series as a boy and it has never left my imagination. The Gunslinger - Roland - is a truly mythic hero with a complicated persona, one that will keep the reader thinking and ultimately waiting to learn more. If you read this book and it hooks you in any way, then continue on with "The Drawing of the Three." You won't be dissatisfied.
Gripping and Majestic After months of hearing about The Dark Tower series, and since I'm already a big Stephen King fan, I decided to finally read the first book in the series, just to see what it was all about. It took me until the last page to decide what I thought of it. All I can say really is that I liked it, and I'm planning to read the next one, but of all the Stephen King books I've read, this was the most difficult and unusual. The problems I had with this book were not stylistic; the book is very well written, and the characters, though mysteriously aloof from the reader, are well developed. The title character, known throughout most of the book simply as the gunslinger, is not easily identifiable as a hero and is deeply complex. There are mysteries surrounding his past, as well as the lives of most of the characters and the reality in which they live. I think it was these very mysteries that I didn't really love. They distressed me unexpectedly. However, being the first book in a series, it's understandable that there will be unanswered questions. Anyone who ventures to read this book should be prepared to read the rest of the series! I certainly will.
Best book ever I would suggest that you read this series befire you watch the movie. You literally fall into the world that King has created. This is a must read for King fans.
the dark tower I: the gunslinger I read everything Stephen King. this series I read many years ago and now that he has finished since so much time passed in between I decided to re-read the 1st 5. I have read 1,2,3 and almost done with 4. Leaves me on the edge of my seat I can't wait to find out the ending.
AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AWESOME THIS BOOK KEPT ME GLUED TO IT UNTILL I WAS DONE. MAN IF YOU DON'T LISTEN TO ANYTHING ELSE I SAY, READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Good introduction to a series This book was a very decent introduction to a cool series. It wasn't one of my favorite King books, but as far as world-building goes, it really hit the spot.
a review of 'The Gunslinger' OVERALL COMMENTS: Worth reading if you a ready to tackle the 7-novel Dark Tower Series, but not critical. Well-written story but goes nowhere fast. PLOT: A bad-ass gunslinger (wild west type) from an alternate Earth-like world is slowly and methodically chasing a mystery 'man in black' across the desert. He is not sure why he is chasing the man but somehow knows he holds the answers to the strange universe the gunslinger finds himself in. On the way, he must battle possessed and demented inhabitants of this world that seems post-apocalyptic and just a bit off-kilter. PROS: A story with an addictive curiousity about it. Well-written at the ground-level. CONS: Slow moving. Nothing much of importance is revealed until the very end and then its still a bit confusing. Not that exciting. PERSONAL NOTE: I get the feeling King was just exploring a vague notion of a plot while writing this and this was more of a creative writing exercise that he decided to continue with. Now that I've read the second book, I realize I could have skipped this one completely.
A quick read and a simple plot. Even slow readers will have no problem plowing through this book. It's important to come into this book not expecting a WoT, SoT, or ASOIAF. Although the paperback version is some 300 pages, it would be about 150 pages in the same font and typeface as the others. If you read this book, simply expect a character introduction and a very enjoyable (extended) short story. This book was definitely a good change of pace from other books that I've read. There isn't too much fluff and pretty much everything that happens is explained thoroughly and not excessively. There isn't too much going on in the plot: there's one man, and one objective. There are only a few flashbacks and they are all fully integrated and understandable withing the context of the quest. There's no huge build-up that the world is about to end, only a simple struggle of man against man. If you are expecting a huge, epic journey from the start, you may be disappointed. If you want to read a book that gives a solid introduction into an epic journey, pick this book up and I assure you that you will pick up book 2.
Oh, Roland, how noble the night! One wonders at what point in this narrative King determined to expand his tale. it appears early on as though headed for a traditional conclusion but somewhere towards center one senses a slowing, literary palaver.
A great book and a good start for great story I just finished re-reading The Gunslinger. I must confess that when I read it for the first time I was not impressed. I have decided to re-read it after I have read the first 4 books and Surprise! Surprise! it was much more interesting. I think the reason behind it is that I have got to know Roland better from the book 4 - Wizard and Glass (about his past). It helped to understand The Gunslinger. In the introduction and foreword of this new edition S. King mentions The Lord of the Rings a few times and that he wanted to write as great book or better. To tell truth, while reading the following books, I felt an influence of Tolkien, which is a positive sign. This edition is very well made. It has a beautiful dust jacket and many "odd" pictures inside. They are trying to convey some of the ideas of the book but sometimes they are so obscure it is hard to understand what the artist wanted to tell us. All in all, in my opinion The Gunslinger is a great book and a good start for great story.
Stephen King is brilliant to say the least!!! Well when I first heard about The Gunslinger, and the whole Dark Tower series I was pretty skeptical and wondered where Stephen King was going with the whole idea. But, being that I am a big King fan, I thought that I should go ahead and read The Gunslinger to see just how good it is. That was one of the best decisions that I have ever made(as far as reading is concerned). It is hard to say whether this book is one of literature, western, fantasy, or just another one of Stephen King's amazing craftmanships. The only disappointment that I had with the book is just how slow-moving it is, and how it seems to be holding off alot for the future. On the other hand, that is what makes this book work so well and nearly impossible to put down. I will definately read the next couple of books in the Dark Tower series hoping to get another great response from them. If any of you are curious about how good it is, you might as well just go ahead and read it to see what I mean. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!! Well I guess you could be if you know nothing about books. :)
An enjoyable read A very solid book that sets the theme for the series. I enjoyed how King has woven together Western, SciFi and Fantasy genres in this first volume.
THE FIRST OF A GREAT SERIES My son picked up this book because someone left it under his desk in his Accounting class. My son is in 11th grade and is 16. He started reading it and couldn't put it down. He had never read Stephen King before, but he has seen many Stephen King movies and enjoyed them. My son doesn't usually pick up books for enjoyment, he only reads books if it is assigned for school. He read a lot of the book the first night, but realized that the person who left the book in his Accounting class, would miss the book, so he returned the book to school the next day. The next day I bought him the book so he could finish reading it. He enjoyed reading the book over Christmas break and now has taken out of the school library Stephen King's second in the Dark Tower series titled The Drawing of the Three. I recommend this book for anyone to read, but I especially recommend you get this book for a teenage boy to get them to read for enjoyment which is the best reason to read!
STRONG FICTION! THE GUNSLINGER is a book that tends to be hard to explain. It is a story about a gunslinger (there's a zinger!) who is searing for the "man in black" (and it isn't Will Smith!). Upon his journey, he befriends a little boy and is forced to examine himself. It was a very well written novel. It wasn't too long like many of King's novels tend to be. One of my favorite parts was when the gunslinger battles with the SLOW MUTANTS. This book is classic fiction. It's different from a lot of the mainstream fantasy in so many ways. 1) It's dark fantasy. To be taken seriously. 2) It's not one of those "Oh, but it will have a happy ending" type novels. 3) It's real. So real you can actually walk through the pages. The illustrations were good too. If you'rw wondewring why this version costs more than a few of the others it's because of the picture. I think it's better with the pictures. It's meant to be illustrated. Buy this book. It's on of those you'll be proud to have collecting dust on your book- shelf.
very good Stephen King added a new twist to his writing humor. This book is a solidly good from start to finish. As they say a "must read".
Stephen King shows off his talents Many people have heard of The Dark Tower. I am currently reading the series, and I will publish a review for each book as I read them. This is the first book in the long series, and it really makes me hungry for more. Warning: this review will have spoilers. The Good: The characters are realistic and belivable. Roland really does feel guilt for his actions. He makes some really hard choices in this book, like having to sacrifice Jake in order to get to the Man in Black. Several questions are raised: how much does Roland really want to give up if it means getting to the Dark Tower? There are some very suspenseful scenes (my favorite was the chapter with the Slow Mutants) and some sad ones (having to kill his girlfriend to spare her a miserable life, sacrificing Jake, etc.). The Man in Black hightens the suspense when he propechies Roland's future. The Bad: Nothing was bad about this book! In short, this novel was awesome, and I cannot wait to buy the next few books in the series.
King, but not entirely like King. One of the 10 best "The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed." For whatever reason, it's the most memorable opening line I've read. This is the first book in King's post-apocalyptic/parallel worlds Dark Tower series. The gunslinger is a character inspired by the Man with No Name that Eastwood played in the cinema. Certainly he is one of King's best characters. This story melds magic and firearms in an unforced, entertaining way. It's written in a dry, dusty style that suits the gunslinger perfectly. Aside from the fact that the book is very entertaining in its own right, King fans simply MUST read the Dark Tower books, because these days, ALL his other books at least make reference to the Tower, if they aren't extremely intertwined, like Hearts in Atlantis and Black House. These references in other books are like big fat Easter Eggs; you're finding unexpected rewards everywhere! This book is one I'd never do without. Go get it!
The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger It was a fantastic book, great describing persons and everything else. It is the best book I've read. And it's King's best work so far.
The Dark Tower Awaits I started reading the Dark Tower series a few months ago. I am about halfway through and I have thoroughly enjoyed it so far. I purchased the updated and revised version of The Gunslinger and at first I was really annoyed with the book. Now that I am in book three of the story I overlook how I felt initially, but for those preparing to start the series understand that The Gunslinger is by far the slowest and most difficult book to read. The book follows the Gunslinger across a desert and in between words following the mysterious Man In Black. Even though the book is at points slow there are some really great moments that are very relevant in the entire story. I am reading the Waste Lands right now and a lot of what takes place in the Gunslinger is still relevant to the story. Reservations aside I recommend this book wholeheartedly. The storytelling is top notch and the world that Stephen King created is rich in detail and large in scope.
Great read. The incredible & strange imagination of Stephen King combined with his ability paint vivid pictures with words makes this a great read.
Can be read as a single book While this is the first in a seven part series, The Gunslinger has a different feel from the rest of the series and it can stand alone.
Stunning... a Masterpiece One of my greatest inspirations as a writer and an artist, The Gunslinger delivers hardcore. This tale is a post-apocalyptic fantasy that is gleaned from a mishmash of genres, fusing such unexpected time periods and societies as the Old West, medieval feudalism, and sci-fi futuristic. Roland, the figure that is central to the tale (and those that follow) is a stoic but tormented figure, part fairy story hero, part gritty Clint Eastwood antihero via Pale Rider or High Plains Drifter. Fans of numerous genres (fantasy, gothic, western, sci fi, post-apocalyptic, steampunk) will thrill at this can't-put-down read, which is refreshingly short for Mr. King (who has a tendency to pack a lot of unnecessary tangents and deadwood in with some of his novels). At under 250 pages, the book is a quick, but not too quick, adventure that will leave you thinking about the characters and their plight long after the last page has been turned.
Realization I find myself coming back to the "Gunslinger" as a reference book for all of the DT books and those that are related. I thoroughly enjoyed the Gunslinger and the more I read it the more I see Stephen King daydreaming a reoccuring dream and putting it on paper. I found there had to be more to the story and am elated that he has written continuosly about this series, either along the Dark Tower series or others such as "The Stand", "Salem's Lot" (Which I am reading again now),"Rose Madder" ...etc. I have almost wanted to go back in time and study his writings but find I would probably go mad and end up in "End World" right the with the rest of you and the King himself (Stephen King that is). I have been lucky enough to find an original hardcover printing of the "Gunslinger" numbered and all. It may not be pristine but it is a jewel to be treasured. I wish you all "long days" and will meet you at the "Tower".
A dissapointment. Mostly boring. “Gunslinger” is book one of Stephen King’s Dark Tower series. I believe there are eight books in the series. Not sure if that’s the end or if there are more books to come – and probably won’t find out. I was completely disappointed with this book. I read a lot, but I’ve not read a lot of King. The two books that I did read by him were years ago. I came into this one with high expectations because the book was pretty well reviewed and because Stephen King is known as one of the most popular and prolific authors of our time. Unfortunately what I hoped would be a masterpiece was disappointing in almost every way. In this book, King uses a lot of words but never really says anything. The story opens with “Gunslinger” walking across the desert chasing after “the man in black”. It’s not till three quarters of the way through the book that we even find out who “Gunslinger” is – ninety percent before we find out who “the man in black” is. There is very little to no plot development. It’s just Gunslinger constantly traveling through mostly deserted towns and landscapes looking for the man in black. Half the book takes place when Gunslinger stops in a little town and shacks up with the girl who owns the bar there for about a week. After he leaves there, he meets up with a boy living by himself in the middle of nowhere and adds him to his entourage (now consisting of two). Together they continue to chase the man in black. The last ten percent of the book is better than the rest and once we do finally get a few answers and have some things start to happen, it does make me curious to find out a little more about the dark tower. That said, I don’t know that it makes me curious enough to risk trudging through another mostly boring book. Probably done with this series.
A trip through the unknown world of desolate edification. What a read this book is. From the opening sentence to the final word it is gripping and disturbing. Painting a world that the reader is glad to not be apart of, yet fascinated to read about, the story creeps along slowly revealing the protagonist and his intention. Only in the last chapter do we find out what has been happening to him and why he is on this journey. If it is a success is up to the reader to determine, but it definately fullfills its potential with a spellbinding conversation that is as provokative as Aurthor C Clarke's 2001: A Space Odysse. A remarkable tail of travel that's a combination of magic, mystery and journey, a mysterious hero and a dark and equivicol villian. This is just the begginning of the remarkable tale of the dark tower that King has yet to complete. Four episodes have been released so far and i have just started the drawing of the three. Hope you dig itr as much as i did.
enough to keep me interested There was enough going on to keep me interested and looking forward to the next book. I would recommend to any fan of the rings
slow going Highly recommended by a friend I trust, but I am finding it slow to grab my interest and tough to invest in the gunslinger, but that is typical of King's protagonists for me. I shall give the next book in this series a shot.
One of the most genuinely gripping books of all time I have read The Gunslinger four times now. Every time that I read it, I tell myself, "It's time to read the entire series." But for some reason I always quit after this, the first novel in the series. I'm still not sure why I have never continued on with the other books, but I am currently on another mission to read the entire Dark Tower saga. After finishing The Gunslinger (again) I think that I finally realized why I haven't gone on to finish the series. I think that I am afraid to find out the answers to all the questions posed in this amazing novel. I'm just afraid that I'll be disappointed with the ultimate answers. The conversation at the end of this novel is totally amazing and completely invigorating on an intellectual level. So how can Stephen King possibly follow it all up? I hope that he does in a grand fashion. Because this time, I intend to find out those answers.
It's the beginning of a fascinating tale. Stephen King embarks in a very long tale that only begins in this book and is supposed to take 5 or 6 other books to finish. Reading this book you have to understand that it is merely the beginning, and yet it is a very good book in itself. In "The Gunslinger" you enter the life of the last gunslinger in a world that has "moved on", in his quest for the "Dark Tower" which in my opinion symbolizes the domain of the universe, some form of heaven. In this first book the gunslinger follows the man in black, who is his enemy. It takes you a while to understand and identify yourself with the gunslinger's world, but when you do, you can't get enough of it. I recommend it if you are planning on reading the others that follow. I am currently reading the third (The Waste Lands), and I have to say that you really get hooked when you are reading the second book
Review for Unabridged Audiotape version 1) Too bad King read his own book. A professional actor/reader would have made this so much more interesting than King's droning voice. The Insomnia auidobook was much more interesting to listen to. 2) I quite midstream as the story just was confusing at times with little or no information on the world created. Some parts mirror our world and others don't. 3) The one thing I did like is that there was a real sense of dread around each bend. You didn't know what traps the Man in Black had laid for the Gunslinger and this is what kept me going at least to the mid-point. I had become disenchanted with King's work about 7 years ago and this is the first thing I came back to since then. I felt disappointed to the point that unless I have three really good friends whoes' opinions I trust tell me to read a particular King book...only then will I give King another chance.
The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger Ths is an interesting storyline, and having read the whole Dark Tower series before, it's an easy read. One I'd recommend.
the beginning of a saga For the first book, it starts off slow but picks up pace near the end setting up the next chapter which is much better
A Great Premise With a Rough Start In this first installment of Stephen King's Dark Tower series, we're introduced to a desert landscape where, as King cryptically explains, the world has moved on. For reasons unknown, the gunslinger, Roland Deschain, must find the dark tower and to do that he must catch a nefarious and enigmatic character from his past: the man in black. It's all pretty vague, and the narrative tends to be as thin as the volume itself, particularly when Roland's pursuit leads him out of the desert with a young companion, Jake, who he stumbled upon along the way. This isn't to say The Gunslinger is a bad book, and it certainly can't be called boring. As simple as The Gunslinger's premise is, it's extremely effective at keeping the reader engrossed, and King sets up some really terrific scenes along the way. Unfortunately, King appears to be fumbling to figure out what his story is about. Mashing elements of fantasy and western together turns out to be an intriguing concept but, between bland flashbacks that provide plenty of action but paltry character insight and a complete lack of limitations on what this fantasy world cannot be, The Gunslinger feels undercooked. In his introduction King seems to be aware of this and comments that he has gone back and tuned the story up a bit, but clearly there's only so much that can be done. Ultimately, the book's small size is its greatest asset and liability. Rather than the first installment of a series, The Gunslinger feels like only the first few shaky chapters, establishing little more than a basic premise. But if you're on board with the premise, you're sure to pick up the next installment.
Surreal and Involving This book was not a pleasure to read, nor did it have a particularly strong plot, but that's okay, because those aren't the point here. This novel is about a character (the Gunslinger), and an idea (the world has moved on). The world is surreal and involving, invoking the imagination and the mind. This book is more than an anthology, but less than a picaresque -- it's a series of occurences which are related but separate, each further defining and revealing the gunslinger, his past, his world, and his quest to find the mysterious "man in black," who will somehow guide him to the magical Dark Tower. This is actually the first Stephen King novel that I've read that I've liked. It is alluring, refreshing, and thought-provoking, marred only by spelling and grammatical errors -- glammer rather than glamour, etc.
Gunslinger is a page turner The Gunslinger is a book that exceded my predictions. Stephen King did an excellent job of connecting the characters so that they seemed real life people. The book is about a gunslinger named Roland who is in search of "the dark tower" which is a place where he is destined to go for some unknown reason. In the beginning chapters there is great action scene of Roland taking out an entire town of people. The antaginist in this story is "the man in black" who Roland sees as somebody acting against him, but in reality he acts as sort of a guide to Roland. There are also many characters in the story such as boy who Roland befriends and takes him along on his travels. You also learn more about Rolands past and other characters involved. I gave The Gunslinger 4 stars which is a rating that this book deserves.
The beginning or the saga!! The beginning of one of the best series ever! This was a gift for my father. I love all of the dark tower books!
Excellent A great start to a great series. Roland is one of stephen kings deepest and most fascinating characters. Bravo!
Badass book; nuff said Well, maybe there is more to say cuz this book is one pardon the phrase "badass mofo". It has it all: action, drama, suspense, romance, just everything you think of when you think of a hardcore Clint Eastwood Bonanza movie vibe. Roland is a great main character too, real fresh-faced killer mentality with a hint of compassion at the same time for the less fortunate along the way in the journey, or his love interest Alice who he has to end up killing ironically. To sum this piece up a must read for those hardcore King fans like myself or just if you like a good mysterious plot-twisting tale of dark wizardry and zigzags throughout. Good stuff and I'm not even an avid reader either, imagine that, it's just that easy to get involved, go hed phonics monkeys, join in. lol peace out
The Journey to end all Journeys Though not a typical Stephen King in the sense of the macabre and horrifying tales we're used to, this book snagged me back when I was in the 7th grade. It was the most amazing tale that I had ever read and I waited, on the edge of me seat, for all of the subsequent novels to follow. King has been writing this tale, and linking it to so many other books of his, that the full scope of Roland's journey is incredible. The entire series is a must read for usual King fans as well as everyone else. It's not horrifying and 'mess yourself' scary - it's beyond. I've read thousands of books in my time and this tale, the full tale of Roland and his fellow travelers, is by far the favorite of all time for me...
Mixed Feelings I've read the whole series, and honestly that is the only way that this book can be appreciated. When spoken of in the context of the series it is a magnificent piece of work that leads your mind into realms of thought that you never knew existed. However, when it is looked at as a single book it is fairly weak. It ends with only a hint of closure that the dark man was found. As another reviewer has stated this easily could have been merely added onto the second part of the series (The Drawing of the three), and then it would have bolstered the strength of both stories. My four stars are generous when they rate just this book, but when used as a rating for what it fortells of what is to come, it is a pitiful grading scale because mere stars cannot define its impact.
The beginning of a very long tale. I picked up a copy of The Gunslinger to read on the airplane when I took my family to Disney World this summer. On December 5, I completed the last book of the Dark Tower series. If you don't have time or desire to read the 4000+ pages of DT, walk away now. The Gunslinger is a little slow to read because it is written backwards, you meet up with the main character after most of the action in the book has come to pass and then go in reverse back through the story. There is a lot of time spent developing characters that never enter the story after book one of the series. The Dark Tower is a great series and if you have the time and patience to read it, it is worth the effort. The Gunslinger is an interesting tale but you really are only getting started when the book ends.
Somewhat confusing as you read it, but looking back it really sticks with you. I read about 100 pages of this, stopped it, then after reading some reviews on the collection of books in this story, decided to muddle through. It was hard for me to get through it, but once I did, it really left an impression with me. It's hard to explain, but looking back after having read all 7 of the books, this one is most certainly a great start. It sets a mood that just clicked with me. I really didn't appreciate it as much as I read it or even right after I read it. Really it did not resonate with me until I was into the 3rd or 4th book. Anyway, as I know other reviewers have pointed out, the first of the series is the hardest to get through, but once you do, you'll quickly be rewarded for it and looking back will likely remember this book more fondly.
I'm Hooked...and I'm Sure they Get Better I recently finished "The Gunslinger," which I knew would lead me on a 12-book journey. I started all of this because I am a Stephen King fan and because my nephew bought me the first three Dark Tower books for Christmas last year (I did hestitate a little). I was interested from page one and knew I was hooked! I now know I'll be finishing this series. As is typical of Stephen King, the characters were lovable. However, the book got a little wordy and boring near the end. It was somewhat confusing, as though King wasn't quite able to clearly describe what was going on in his imagination as he wrote this. But still, the book remained interesting enough to finish, the characters were great, and I feel it's worth moving on to book number 2.
Roland It took me a bit of scepticisim and some hard work to get through this book, but by the end I was convinced that there was some hope, and that Stephen King wasn't a bad writer after all. I read On Writing first by him, and was hooked, by line and sinker on that one. His poetry freed my mind and taught me a little something that I didn't know before. Something different. I really liked Roland to be the bad guy in good situations. I didn't know how to respond to that! I was touched and I was intrigued all at the same time. I liked a lot how King depicted the people he met along the way in Tull, and then the way they died...very vivd I might say. 4 Thumbs up Mr. King!
could not stop reading The Gunslinger I have not read any Stephen King in many years; a reference to the number 19 and The Gunslinger, by a coworker, got me curious. Now, I am hooked. The Gunslinger is neither a western novel nor a horror novel in the classic sense of either of those genres; it is more of a combination of fantasy and suspense with a splash of the horrific and a touch of the western. Excellent character development kept me worried as to what was going to happen next. The use of Old West objects, and some mid-century technology, in this future world made the world of the gunslinger bizarre and familiar at the same time. I am trying to tell you how cool the Gunslinger and his world is without giving anything away - this is not as easy as I thought.
THE SLOWEST KING BOOK EVER! I have been told and so many of the reviews have stated that this is the most difficult book of the Tower series to get through. That's an understatement. I've plodded through it however, trying to absorb the content enough to have a basis for what I understand are much greater books to follow in this series. I tried reading this when it first came out and put it down quite quickly as it was so dull. I've now managed to get through it on tape and am relieved it's over. I realize it's the foundation for the rest of the series, but I wish I could have skipped it. If the next in the series is this droll, I'll have to eliminate these works from my King favorites. Struggle through it and perhaps you'll enjoy it more than I did.
It's ok... Completely read the dark tower series already but I did so on audiobooks, I just bought this because I like having copies of books ive read so I can show off to people that I read. I like Steven King and think he's a great writer, but overpopularized (but just the way he comes out with books so often is something that's hard to do). This book was ok but I recommend some of his better works like the Tommyknockers, Revival and Doctor Sleep (which is a sequel to the Shining).
The Dark Tower I\The Gunslinger The Gunslinger in my opion is one of Kings best written novels. In this book you are taken to a mythical world where "the world has moved on." While reading this book you meet up with Roland. Roland is the last of the gunsligners in his world. He is on a quest to find the dark tower and set his world right. Then theres Jake, A boy from our world voilently thrust into the Rolands. Jake is the key to the man in black. The man in black is a mysterious man whom Roland has been chasing for a long time. The man in black is a magiacan of sorts and was behind Rolands tormenter in a way. All in all, this book(one of Kings best) is worth the reading
king = hotdogs Stephen King books are like hotdogs - you want one every 5 years and then wonder why you bothered.
The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger The Gunslinger is the first novel of this epic series, The Dark Tower. The Dark Tower shows stephen Kings's excellent achievment.I recomend reading this book. A few of the characters are Roland and Jake Chambers. Roland was Jake Chambers predecesor and a gunslinger. Jake is the boy that Roland met at the Way Station. Jake was hit by a cadillac in the other world,because Roland chose to pursuit the man in black rather than save him. Other characters are Cort, The Man in Black. Cort was Roland's teacher in Tull. The Man in Black has no true identity. I really enjoyed reading this book, when you start reading you really get hooked into it and dont want to put the book down.
Kings best and most obscure The series was mostly in the shadow of kings other works based on the notion that its a western. However the series takes place on many diffrent landscapes and worlds and is a clash of the desolate land Roland the gunslinger is now traveling in and ours. Roland is hot on the tails of the Man in Black who Rolands believes has a key to his true goal the mythical Dark Tower which is in fact existence and the trouble over there is causing problems in his world and many others. The book shows a man who is so determined to reach the tower youll be suprised of the sacrifices he makes and the horrors hes ready to commit for it.
don't worry, it gets better I started reading this book three years ago, at the age of 13. I got 60 pages into it before it was stolen, but I remembered loving it. When I finally got a new copy and read it again this year, I was let down. King explains that he wrote the book over 12 years at different times, and clearly his skill improved with time. The book is at varying levels of quality. The first part seems like a EC-comic western, with bizzare, degenerate characters and bleak, unexplained culture. The book crawls along until the pulse-quickening fourth part, "The Slow Mutants" and the hallucinegenic final chapter. It's a short book, and quick reading, but it's a weak introduction to the Dark Tower series.
I really enjoyed this book I really enjoyed this book, Stephen King just has a way of drawing you in and not letting go.
A slow start to an impressive undertaking In this first installment of Stephen King's Dark Tower epic we meet Roland, the center of the ka-tet on its way to the Dark Tower. In this chapter, Roland is on the tail of the man in black, chasing him across a vast wasteland in order to confront him. This series is Stephen King's masterpiece. In my mind, Stephen King's multiverse rivals, but of course, cannot surpass, Tokien's Middle Earth. This first book is a bit slow at the start, but is worth working through for the mind-bending ending and of course the following books, which, in my mind, each surpass the previous book. King's series is an immense undertaking, which he has, sadly, said might be his last works.
Modern Magic Realism This is a fun frolic into the early dream world of Stephen King. It's magical realism says that anything can happen in this book, that nothing is taken for granted, and for that reason the reader is absorbed. This writing approach reminds this reader of "The Morning Tree," by Austin Reams. The Morning Tree "The Gunslinger" is clearly King's first books because the plot appears to be created from moment to moment. There is no distinct end: rather each chapter seems to stand on its own as a short story, which is not a detraction. The subsequent books in this series are reportedly more developed. This reader looks forward to them all.
Very Good Book I find King's writing hard to get into, but, the Gunslinger was a book I couldn't put down.
Not as good as it could be I admire Stephen King tremendously for his writing skill, but I thought "The Gunslinger" was something of a disappointment. It's a lot shorter than his other books (it only took me 4 days), but that may be a good thing in this case, since the story seems to wander with no purpose. There are veiled references to some things in Roland's past, but hardly anything is revealed. There are several mentions of the Tower, but nothing is explained until almost the end, and even then it's vague and doesn't fill out the story nearly as well as I expected. I just picked up the second installment of the story, and I've heard it's a lot better. I hope so.
In one word - captivating! For some reason I've put of reading Stephen King's "The Dark Tower" for quite some time now. Many people have recommended the series, but I guess I've been biased: I didn't think Stephen King would be able to write a good fantasy novel, let alone a series. I was wrong. Dead wrong. From the first sentence, "The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed", I knew I was hooked. Just shy of a week later I had nearly completed the first four books of the series. And in my opinion, that's a great review in itself. If you like fantasy novels, mystery, a bit of horror and good old western tales (be it books or movies), this is a book for you!
The Beginning but not the End. I remember picking this book up the first time when I was 12 and being scared by the opening scene. Who was the man in black? And why did Clint Eastwood want to catch him? I waited years in between books as King decided if he wanted to finish the series. Unfortunately he got into that car accident and decided to rush the last three books which gave the series a whiplash finish. But to be sure, the first 4 books in this series are amazing and could stand up to any other epic book series. But this book has a feel different than the others. This one is raw, real and filled with the love of a young Stephen King who just wanted to create his own world.
Five Stars Excellent story to start the Dark Tower series. Many plot lines set up in the first book.
just great I have no words. Just read it. The Dark Tower serie is the best (if any) of Stephen King
Not one of Kings Best, but it has possibilites I must admit that I am used to Kings books being faster paced with a lot of information about the characters. This book was not like that. Roland is a gunslinger trying to get to The Dark Tower. The book leads you through the desert of Rolands world with a few flashbacks to younger times. The flashbacks were interesting as I was always feeling that I wanted more information about Roland, the main character. I guess I will have to read the rest of the series to find out more. All in all this book is an ok start to the series "The Dark Tower" and I will read the next book "The Drawing of the Three" to see where King leads Roland.
Not your usual King This novel is an expansion of a short story of the same name. The gunslinger Roland, is on a quest. The bad guy is none other than Randall Flag (The Stand), a truly evil character, King's best villian. The story, though is rambling and unstructured. There is the feeling that the fleshing out of this excellent short work into novel form was rushed. A few more revisions prior to release and this would have been work worthy of standing with King's best. All in all, a good read for King fans. If you are going to try him for the first time, (Where have you been, in a cave?) then try The Night Shift, his best short story collection
Review? It's a King... what else?. Stephen King is a master of his genre. There is nothing that can be compared with him. Maybe I could say Poe or Lovecraft, but I think its no use in comparing. He is just King... Stephen King.
ESSENTIAL If you are not familiar with the D.T. series you owe it to yourself to read the THE GUNSLINGER first, before any of the others. Sure it's weird a little at first and kinda hard to get into, but the information and relationship you form with Roland is vital (in my opinion) for you to be fully engulfed in the rest of the series. I really loved the DT series and will be recommending it to people for all my days. He is a master of his craft (well .... both Roland and Stephen actually) and by reading this first you will feel the full flow of the story, just as ol'Stevo would have hoped I'm sure.
Amazing I read all books in this series and I was disappointed with the ending. To be fair, I think it's because I had unreal expectations. Up until the last book this series was my favorite (above The Lord of the Rings and the Ender's Game series). The only problem I had was his last book, but only because of how great the six books preceding the finale are. King does a great job of character development throughout the whole series and in some of the gunfights it really feels like you're there along with the characters pulling the trigger. Despite the last book I love this series and recommend it to anyone who asks about it.
Introduction This book is a very strange book. Stephen King can write strange stuff but this is way out there. It takes place in a parallel unverse to ours, I think. This book is an introduction to the Dark Tower series of which there are 4 books so far. This one tells part of Roland's (the last Gunslinger) journey across a vast desert to catch up with the man in black. He meets a boy, Jake, from our world and befriends him. Most of it is the Gunslinger reflecting on some of his journey and some of his childhood. There isn't too much action until the last 50 pages or so. Alone it isn't too good but it fits in with the series.
The Gunslinger - The dark Tower Bk 1 Excellent! It took forever to get the 1st book on CD. Now my collection is complete.
The beginning of an epic journey. The start of king's magnum opus, the dark tower, the gunslinger. Very quickly the reader is sucked into rolands universe. A gunslinger in a dieing world where at first we don't know very much except that he's chasing the man in black across the desert. The book then starts to feed us bits and pieces of the gunslingers back story and introduces us to a few characters from his past we have not yet met but are starting to learn about. I thought this was a fantastic novel, and enjoyed it from the first page all the way to the back cover. Very well written and imaginative, the gunslinger is a triumph! Read it now.
Hard to rate This one was hard to rate. It's a very strange book. There is some fantastic characterization, as always with King, but then again the story barely makes sense at times. One thing I didn't like was the "fated" feel of everyone in the story. It damaged my suspension of disbelief, as I felt the author was so clearly making everything up and shaping it so things had to go his exact way. In short, there is some fantastically good imagery, and some might love it, but I didn't get drawn into the story because I found people to surreal.
Short. But a good read. The Gunslinger is book about a super-hero persuing an arch villan in another dimension. It's like a darker version of the Batman comics. Everything about it is unoriginal. The most unoriginal character is The Man in Black. People who see UFO's have reported being visited by mysterious "men in black" since the 1950's. The 1997 feature length film was based on a comic book. The Gunslinger is just Superman fighting Lex Luther. The other characters are stupid and don't do anything. Other than that, it has a very thin plot. I mean, why is the Gunslinger fighting The Man in Black anyway?
Just what I was looking for Over the past 6 months I have been reading Stephen King's Dark Tower series, today I have finally finished his last book of the series; and, it did not dissapoint. I am already missing reading about Roland and his epic quest to see the dark tower, King managed to keep me hooked in the whole way and rarely was there dull moment. The first book in the series 'The Gunslinger', was a nice and short entry into the beginning of Roland's quest, leaving me desperately wanting more. This book came highly recommended to me by a friend and now I am highly recommending it to any one reading this review.
The Best of Fiction - I Set My Watch and Warrant On It. I can't rate this without considering the books that follow, but what I can say is that this tale is a magnificent one. Beyond a doubt my favorite story, however desolate and terrifying the world, one that draws together the very center of being and taps into a great many truths behind fiction. If you're looking for adventure, agony, kindness, cruelty, nobility, mystery, horror, romance and a great deal of deep thought (and quite a bit more) dig in and read this series. Way to go Stephen, I know it wasn't easy, but you did it. Now you can breathe...or as someone else might say "Kiyit Ephen"
King is a masterful storyteller "The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed." If you can resist an opening sentence like that, you have more willpower than I. The Gunslinger begins The Dark Tower series, which follows Roland's quest to reach the nexus of all universes. Since King finished the seven volume series in 2004, it's safe to start reading! I also would highly recommend George Guidall or Frank Muller's narrations. (Nota Bene: This is NOT a horror series or story. King may be best known for writing horror novels, but he is a masterful storyteller and writer in other genres too!)
Amazing Series on Par with GOT Amazing series. On par with Game of Thrones books yet different in a good way
three out of five? Love Stephan King's writing style. He is a truly gifted storyteller and poet. With that being said I don't feel as though he gives you enough substance to satiate the deep hunger of what the $&@& is going on. Will I keep reading more books in the series?... Maybe... But begrudgingly.
I don't get it, but maybe one day I will My review is immature at best. I tried reading this, and after three chapters--even though the timing and the seasons was right (awfully hot in late September)--I gave up. A lot of people online say that you definitely shouldn't start with The Dark Tower for Stephen King. I wanted dreadfully to get into this. I've read The Hobbit and the three Lord of the Rings books by Tolkein, Philip K Dick's Man in the High Castle (highly enjoyable, if a bit too nerdy, not being experienced enough with scifi literature yet myself), and quite enjoy fantasy. Actually, this includes Harry Potter and Redwall, whose series I've gone into indepth; of course those may be a bit kiddish and amateur compared, not to mention quite based in reality with a touch of magic, or creatures. I'm afraid that I couldn't enjoy the sparse prose. I really think King himself ruined this for me when he compared DT to his 19 year-old take on The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, a Sergio Leone film which I quite enjoy from the same time in my life. Actually, adding Stephen King's dark world view to the comic world of Leone--even if he means it to be serious, it takes enough of a leap from reality that I find it tragic and funny--should be perfect. Again then, my regrets at missing DT. Like I may have already mentioned, people online say you SHOULD NOT START STEPHEN KING WITH THE DARK TOWER SERIES. I'm instead reading Skeleton Crew, and like the author of that Onion article insisted, have read first Survivor Type, and The Raft (I still have the chills all down my body from that one). I now understand King's diction much better. In DT 1, he at first seems obscure and bewildering. Now I see that SK has a certain way of writing, which I now can appreciate better. Thrillery, almost nihilistic, a mile from Clive Cussler, but much darker; writing without resolve, despairingly deep and awful; pure horror. Anyways, just my take after three chapters of this and SC. If I were a new reader, I think I'd keep with the advice about Skeleton Crew. Best to get introduced to what SK does best before spending weeks on DT 1. But if there are any comments about where exactly DT gets started to rolling, I'd find that helpful. I definitely want to come back to this after reading the essential parts of SC and probably Pet Sematary for my own inclination towards creature/supernatural horror.
Fascinating blend of genres. This blend of sci-fi meets western might not be what is expected from everybody's favorite boogieman, but the way the story unravels page by page will keep you enthralled. As Roland journeys from his home after the world moves on, he sees things he never dreamt of, but discovers that the lessons of his childhood serve him well in any situation. The quest for the Dark Tower, the nexus of worlds becomes his obsession. Long time Stephen King readers will find nuances and innuendos from previous stories interwoven into the story line. Fantastic read.
You have to read this one a couple of times. This is a hard book to rate. It kind of starts in the middle of nowhere and the middle of nothing. The first time I read it I was tempted to give up on it a lot. I kept wondering where is this happening, when is this happening and what the hell is going on? But we meet Roland in the middle of his adventure. My advice is to read it, no matter how confused you get, then read the next 2 in the series and then re-read the first one. It'll make a lot more sense the second time around. Overall, I think it's an excellent intro into Roland's world.
A good yarn with lots of twists I usually never read Stephen King books. However, I was intruiged by the title of book 4, so i bought it and when i realized it was part of a series, i ran out and bought books 1 & 2. I started book one and was immediately drawn in to the world that he created. The character of Roland seems to be very deep--i never know when something from his past is going to come up. I didn't like the character of Jake. I don't really see what overall purpose he served--other than the one he did. I can't wait to start the next book.
This series has brought King back to may reading list I had stopped reading Stephen King becuase it seemed like everything he was writting was just a rehash of his earlier stuff. He was using cookie cutter characters and catering to the mass market. My wife was reading this series and kept talking about it. I picked it up and was glad I did. King was back. The characters in this book were different and you cared about them. The story was something that King hadn't done before and it was something you wanted to read. I couldn't wait to get on to the next ones. They are all great.
GOOD ENDING The ending is what makes this book worth reading. For the most part it is pretty tough to get interested because there are only 2 characters and you can't really relate with either of them. And for the most part nothing happens, just a whole lot of walking accross the desert. Its not exciting in the least. But you do get sucked in just because you want to know what is going on and you don't have any idea until you reach the end of the book. I loved the ending so much I have already begun reading the second book.
Not as good as I'd thought it would be. Considering all the hype and talk about this series, I was expecting this book to be a lot better. I've since read the second and third books and I think the series does get better (the third is my favorate so far). Still, I can't see why it's garnered such support when there are a lot of books out there just as good, if not better. Roland is a good character, but sometimes I think some of the reviewers here have never read anything but a Stephen King book. "The Gunslinger" is not bad but overrated.
Addictive! This is just the beginning of an awesome journey! I actually began this series out of order, but once you start you can't stop! I'm jonesin' for they newest installment of the saga! This is the kind of King only the fans know about, not all out horror he's so popular for. This is a great work of fantasy, and there are hints of it in other stories that all link together for what is already a masterpiece though has not concluded! It's very addictive, I've went back and read each book in the series twice.
An interesting turn An interesting turn for King. Not your typical fantasy, but not your typical horror novel either. It's both, and has a Western flavor to it. It's hard to describe, other than saying the story is intriguing. Why is he reaching the Dark Tower? Who is the man in black? What are these prophecies? Where do they come from? What is the gunslinger's purpose? Is this one giant allegory? These are just a few of the many answered questions that this series provides. A thrilling read.
Best of best Stephen King's writing is always good and satisfying even when his stories are dull (Rose Madder and Gerald's Game) He is really a hell of writer and when he is at his best, he is unbeatable. This series is without doubt one of the best things the 20th and 21th century will see in literary armageddon. Start with this; be patient and fliy with Ronald up to the seventh book (which is to be published soon)
great beginning to an incredible epic Wonderful beginning to an epic fantasy series. As a note to fans of fantasy, this not like any other fantasy series, at least none that I am aware of. The hero is not Aragorn. The hero is a man warped by his quest. Warped into committing acts or allowing acts to take place that we would find reprehinsible. In summary this is a fantasy epic with the dark tint that you would expect from Stephen King.
Not your usual Stephen King but one of the Bes! ! ! First off I'm sick of all the wannabe writers who have to wright a huge reveiew so lets cut to the chase. This book is great with a great story and a great character that keeps you turning pages. Yes this book does leave you asking a lot of questions but it's supposed to do that for the sequels. I already started the next one which is already great and I am already looking forward to the next two.
Achieving the Tower I had difficulties following the story at times, but couldn't seem to put the book down for any length of time. As it progressed, I found myself picking it up and reading "just a few more pages". By the time I finished, I had already ordered the next book in the series, and today ordered the next two. ... If you have patience to wade through some of the areas that are occasionally slow and/or difficult to follow, this is an enjoyable story that will hook you on the series.
Weak Start for an Epic Series This review is based on the original version. In my mind this is a very weak book. I found it very difficult to get through and disjointed. Having said that if you can make it to the second one you will be rewarded for the time invested in this one. The series just keeps getting better and better. King does a great job in making you care about Roland and his Ka-Tet. I have loved this series from the 2nd book to finish. You just have to make it through the first one.
King is the king! this book's language is so completely different from King's other books, that i wasn't even sure whether he really wrote this. his prose here is very threadbare (as opposed to his other books, where he tends to fill every space on the page). the books is quite short compared to other King books, but is immensely readable. it's a bit cryptic at first, but it gains on you slowly.
Enjoyable. Really good read, pulls you deeper into Stephen King's world.
Three Stars I know people love this book. I liked it but did not love it.
Not the best Sci-Fi/Fantasy but very good it is This Serie Is excellent, it provides a very easy entry into fantasy/sci-fi. altough it's always hard to understand in the beginning (all the parts of the serie I mean) all books get more interesting towards the end. It's like you get sucked in, and the best of King's trademarks, creating a whole imaginative world with words, is optimal in these books. "just"four stars, because of the hard start, for the rest it's very recommendable.
Great Read / A little difficult I've been told countless times to read the Dark Tower series, only hearing good things about it. I do have to say that I am glad I read the introduction to The Gunslinger. It helped me understand what I was to expect from the series and why this first book was so rough to read. Aside from the book being a little rough to understand, the actual story kept me wanting more. It did its job in making me want to read the next book in the series.
intriguing, but slow and convoluted Roland, the last gunslinger, pursues the man in black across a Western landscape, a land where time is winding down, meets up with a woman and a kid (from our world), and flashes back to his past and his destruction of an entire town. While the story has potential and intriguing imagery, it is written in so convoluted a manner that the characters and story suffers. I've been told that the sequels are much better, so I will try them. Grade: C
A Look Into the Heros Of The Past Or The Jedis Of Future ? This is truly an outsatanding book with so many twisits and turns. I wasn't sure if I was looking into the past or getting a glimps of the future! This book along with its three following sequells in the Dark Tower Series has left me longing for the series to continue. This book invites you to join Roland and his friends on great adventure and quest! A Great Book that will have you running back to get the second book in the series!
Necessary background, but not a great read The Dark Tower series is a must-read for Stephen King fans and The Gunslinger (Volume 1) is necessary to fully understand the back story and the rest of the works. That said, it's not that great a book on its own. It has a different feel and pace from the other books. Fortunately it's by far the shortest of the series. So put in the effort on this one to enjoy the rest of the series. I found The Drawing of the Three (Volume 2), The Wastelands (Volume 3) and Wolves of the Calla (Volume 5) to be the most entertaining on their own while still advancing the overall series thread.
Good, but caution if you aren't familair with King This book has very little introduction to the world of the Dark Tower, you basically start off in the middle of the story and have to learn what's going on as you read. For this reason the first book can be frustrating. However, by the time you start the second book things become much more clear and it's easier to get wrapped up in the story. Even if you dont like the first, it's well worth it to read the second book.
The Good, The Bad & The King Stephen King puts forward a tale of fantasy that carries with it the mood of apocalypse, restricting the horror genre to be understood between the lines as phylosophical matters are raised. Don't let the first few chapters deceive you, they are dangerously slow-paced and extremely unfriendly to the reader in that they are filled by terms unique to the universe of The Darktower, hoever, soon the reading takes another pace, with a perfect rithm, and the terms gecome self-explanatory by the mere comprehension of context.
The first step in a long walk. Stephen King somewhat strays from his usual wicked, haunting, tales by exploring a deeper side of his talent. The Dark Tower Series is by far one of the most arresting storylines you will ever come across. By the end of the Gunslinger, you will realize how fortunate you are not to have to wait 4 years for the next book to come out. Take your time reading the other three because waiting on a new one is a task....believe me.
Two Stars An interesting story let down by blurry, indulgent prose.
A slow start, but a worth while book This book started really slow, but by the end it was amazing. I excuse the slowness however, since it is all necissary for setting up the rest of the book and series. The insights in this book are truly ingenius: for example, tward the end of the book one of the characters points out that only enemies can tell the truth to each other, friends and lovers lie out of courtesy. It is a well done and facinating story. READ IT!
At Times, Brilliant � At Times, Juvenile At Times, Brilliant - At Times, Juvenile A friend of mine - or maybe I should call him an acquaintance - who seemed to never have enough money to purchase my first novel (if your reading this Mr. King, check it out when you have time - The Running Girl), offered to me an even trade, one day. And this how I happened upon my first Stephen King novel. I must note here that if I have read a Stephen King novel before 2004, it has escaped memory, either due to aging or the late 70's - early 80's; bus number 20 had its own pharmacy. I have of course seen most of the movies. After Cujo, I refused to own a big dog. Now, I think I need to get on with my review. The Gunslinger (The Dark Tower - book one) is a mixed bag, indeed. The novel did keep me interested as I turned the pages, but there were occasional lulls that left me searching for action; I guess that's one way to keep the pages flipping. Walking through the desert or riding a handcar mile after mile can leave even the greatest fiction fan begging for a Slow Mutant attack. But I understand, the gunslinger needs some Roland-time. I just found myself wishing Roland could find a Budget Rent-a-car place to speed up the pace. Don't get me wrong - I'm giving it five stars, dagnabbit. :-) The Gunslinger story line reminded me of Frank Peretti's The Visitation, in that I was constantly wondering if the gunslinger had it all wrong. Is Roland possibly the "bad guy" searching for the good guy? I enjoyed this "not knowing" who Roland really was - it made the story have an addictive appeal. In other words, there was no way I was going to stop reading until I knew for sure. I think Stephen King managed to pull off a great deal with this tale; as Booklist writes: "It mixes the Western, Arthurian, Romance, Science Fiction, and Occultism..." King evenly distributes the mix and somehow makes it all fit together. Bravo to that part of the work - BRILLIANT On to the juvenile: I have yet to understand why great writers (yes Mr. King, I just called you a great writer - at least better than me, for now) must resort to gutterbabble (gutterbabble = the kinds of words, or series of words, that cause an eight-grader to nudge his neighbor in study hall and display his findings). Let's look at a few examples, shall we: [He suspected his father want to XXXX] , [ The gunslinger's genitals felt drawn and hard] , [the warm spray in his crotch as his bladder let go], and [ Beans, beans, the musical fruit...] I think you get the point. Why, oh why, mix this stuff up with some of the extraordinary writing in the story? I know, I know, I've only sold a couple hundred novels and Stephen King is "da' master" at this stuff. But don't I have the right to wonder? Just say yes. There were a few parts in this novel that I felt like King decided to toss in some shooting for the stars stanzas, like: [...hollow grandeur in the place of mean and sweeping passions which once might have erased souls] or [The lines and nets of mesh which held the last jewel at the breast of the world were unraveling] For a second, I thought someone had swapped my book with a Dicken's novel. Special note here: If you are ever suffering from insomnia, any Charles Dicken's novel can help - better than any sleeping pill, it is. More Brilliant stuff: When the "man in black" starts explaining the mystery behind the universe, I literally got goose-bumps. Reminded me of C.S. Lewis and Randy Alcorn and the great writing they have distributed. Man does King shine on those few pages. I was going to write a short story about fish not realizing there is another world above the plane of the pond, but now I would be guilty of plagiarizing if I did. Other great parts of the book: "Only enemies speak the truth. Friends and lovers lie endlessly, caught in the web of duty." BRILLIANT AWARD #1 "They flew like rotten bananas struck from the stem." BRILLIANT AWARD #2 (reminds me of my last bar fight) "The gunslinger felt an urge to find a rock and brain the boy." BRILLIANT AWARD #3 (and I have a new saying) "But in the end, someone always has to have his or her necked popped, as you so quaintly put it. The people demand it. Sooner or later, if there isn't a turncoat, the people make one." BRILLIANT AWARD #4 (so very true) Well, that's my review of The Gunslinger (The Dark Tower - book 1). I hope this helps. I'm sure I will enjoy the second book. See ya next review! (...)
Not King's style, but still very good This book surprised me ALOT. I have read most of King's works and have found them all quite enthralling (let aside "Gerald's Game") and yet I had read none of the books in the 'Dark Tower' series, so with nothing else to read, I read "The Gunslinger". I read this book in one day, as it was very interesting, intriguing, and full of suspense. I can't wait to read the other books in this series.
Interesting The Gunslinger was a very interesting and intriguing book. I like books with new concepts, not the same old love story or action book. The Gunslinger tale is very unique. My head was constantly swirling attempting to grasp where exactly Roland was. King does an amazing job describing the landscape, action scenes, and thoughts of Roland the Gunslinger. I look forward to reading the rest of this series.
Just no comment! Read it!!! ..and ya`ll get hooked onto Dark Tower for a long-long time! As I was... for 10 years. I read Gunslinger in 1995 being 20 y/o... and yesterday (2.10.2005) I finished the last book!!! What a journey! It was just soooo great! For those, who are just starting with this first book, my personal favorites are #1, #4 and #5, but that by no way means, that one should skip anything!!!
A non stop thriller! This being the first Stephen King book I have ever read really made me want more. As soon as I was finished with the book I went to buy the next in the series, "The Drawing of the Three". And I hardly ever read books. I am a student and was required to read a book and was actually glad to read this one. I recommened this book to anyone who likes alot of action, doesn't everyone?
Really Good Roland the Gunsnlinger has been after The Man in Black for a while now. He has been unsuccessful so far. The book is very short compared to other King books, but the flashbacks and present storyline of the book prove very entertaining, especially for SK fans. Funny how my reviews seem to come out short. :D
Great beginning for a wonderful series I first stumbled upon the Gunslinger in middle school and have been hooked on the Dark Tower ever since. With it's gritty fantasy feel and an eerie undertone, it sets the reader on a spellbinding journey following Roland's quest for the Dark Tower. King's stark descriptions of this world and it's people are totally amazing. I highly recommend this book and the following volumes.
So much better the second time around The first time I read this book, I was lost and wasn't sure I'd make it through the entire book. The ending was worth it and at the time, I thought the most important part of the book. Now, having read the entire series AND re-reading this one, I see all the hidden messages, meaning and importance of the information shared and I'm in awe. I love this book the second time around.
Meh Even Stephen King said this one was "Meh".

great book, nice start to the series I had been looking for a new series for quite awhile. I have to say I quite like this series so far. It is a little slow moving at first, but I am told that it picks up speed greatly as the series increases. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes Stephen King or just likes fantasy in general. It has undertones of horror, which makes it even more rich. Enjoy!
Amazing mix of a western/fantasy. The start of a great tale The gunslinger, takes you to a world that is beyond our own but shares some common history. It takes you to the start of Roland's great quest, and makes you wish you could go with him. It also shows you that Roland quest, is the most important thing in his life. After I read this story I never had more anticipation in my life as I waited for the next installment.
It's good, but still doesn't stand up to the series. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad book. But it's rather slow, and gets a bit dull at times. Don't give up though, this is the first in one of the the best series I ever read! The second is the best, and the third and fourth are great as well. Just read this as an opening, and then continue to the rest (they're great, trust me). Long live the dark tower series!
It don't get much better than this The best way to describe this book is, it's one of those books that makes you attack people if they interrupt you while you're reading it. It's fantastic. Roland the Gunslinger is, by far, King's most convincing and haunting character, and the rest of his ka-tet are also fantastically well-written. This book makes you wonder where King comes up with this stuff.
Good book. King has created another great character. This book is full of great charactes and a world that could of only come from King. A world that is full of evil and death, I admired Roland's courage. His quest for the man in black, his love for Jake, and the feelings for Alice. It had its boring parts, but I still loved it. I really liked the scene were Roland kills the whole town. Very well written.
Feh! Maybe read a later effort, and come back to this when (and if) addicted. The immature writing is hard to get through....I'll eventually finish it so I can go and read on.....this is an early effort and it shows, but knowing the measure of the writer by his later works, I'm guessing the whole series is worthwhile. There's just a lot of other good stuff out there, making this one a bit of a chore. If someone out there will do a synopsis of this and any others of this series that precede King's less flawed efforts, I'll gladly pass this up.
A powerful, stark, nightmarish book I recently finished "The Dark Tower", the final book in the series, and have had time to reflect on King and his writing style. These are my thoughts on the original novel, not the 2003 updated version. The Gunslinger is written unlike any other book I have ever read; a stark, romantic style, with imagery bordering on nightmares - not the nightmares of monsters, but nightmares more along the lines of "The Shawshank Redemption" - a creeping, deja-vu horror as time passes. Due to the starkness, much is left up to your imagination, and this lends to King treating his audience intelligently. For example, the man in black being revealed as Walter, a character obviously important to Roland but having no previous mention in the book, was genius. So was Walter's explanation of time, the universe, and the Tower. It genuinly seems that King is on an epic quest for truth. Unfortunately, King lost this writing style right at the beginning of DT2, and has not regained it in any of the other 5 novels. The other DT novels are verbose, tangent driven, with King explaining everything as if the reader lacked the ability to draw inferences. DT4 was the only other book I would possibly recommend, but it pales significantly in comparison to this. Finally, on the character of Roland. Characters remain interesting in a series as long as they refuse to reveal their animus - their essential nature. Who they truly are. Once you figure out the main character in a series, it's much harder to keep your interest. This is why series such as Richard Stark's Parker books remain fresh even after 17 books and 40 years - he is a man of action, and action, not words, define the character. Concurrently, King gives you hints at Roland's character - Cort's teachings, the hanging, the coming of age, his sacrifice of Jake - but he never reveals how he works. Roland, too, is a man of action. Unfortunately, this ambiguity over Roland's animus fades in the subsequent books as the series becomes bloated.
A Rare Stephen King Misfire While reviewing the first book, "The Gunslinger", of Stephen King's "Dark Tower" series, I am trying to not let the brilliance of the subsequent editions cloud my judgment on this one. I am a "late" fan of King (still working my way through all his novels), and I finally decided to begin the journey to the Dark Tower. However, after reading this first installment, it took an editor's note from King himself to get me excited about continuing with Roland on his quest. The main problem I had with this book is that absolutely no context is given for Roland's world on his travels as the book opens. Roland is wandering through a land that looks like our own but definitely is not, contains mutant monsters, and for some reason a "Man In Black" that Roland is compelled to follow. As I continued reading, those mysteries were only beginning to be touched on as the novel came to a close. Thus, I spent way too much time trying to figure out just what the heck was going on (a task that is nearly impossible without reading the next few installments anyway) and less time just enjoying the adventure. At the conclusion of my reading, I wondered exactly how Stephen King was going to make an interesting story out of this. Little did I know that King is actually utilizing a form of background storytelling, where the events in this book are not fully explained for two, three, or even four books down the line. I did not care for this type of narrative, as it creates way too much confusion and too little of the mystery that King likely was gunning for. So, if you are looking to start your own quest for the Dark Tower, you still need to read this book, but keep firmly in your mind that the series absolutely explodes in the next few books, which is far different from the glacial-like pace of this first try.
Life is too short to read this book I can't help the way I feel. This may be Stephen King's magnum opus, but I think it's a magnum flop. The Gunslinger is not at all entertaining, intriguing, or thought-provoking. It's not even fascinating in that pretentious, learned literary way. No, it's just incredibly boring; if boredom doesn't get ya the confusion will stop you in your tracks. Throughout the book, you don't know why the characters are there, you cannot understand the significance (if any) of any of the boring things they're doing, and after a while you're so bored that it makes no difference to you that it makes no sense. You just stop and wonder why you are wasting your time when there are probably twenty or thirty GOOD Stephen King books you could be reading instead. Even if you're disappointed in the outcome of a particular King book, such as 'It,' you will probably still have been thoroughly entertained during the course of the book, and if nothing else you will at least have learned the names of the main characters and their purpose within the first chapter or two. Not so with The Gunslinger. I checked out many of the positive reviews on this book and am not surprised to find out many of them are actually reviews of the entire series, which, from what I understand, does "pick up." If I were going to bother finishing the series, I'm sure I would recall the utter drudgery of The Gunslinger and, might be able to consider it in retrospect as a "series intro" or a "means to an end." But considering it that way still does not, unfortunately, magically transform The Gunslinger into a good book. And for me, life's too short to read an entire awful book and then take a chance the others in the series will somehow prove to be less awful.
Good start This novel is indeed a good start to a series, however there are too many flashbacks without any real discriptive histories. The character Roland isn't developed like King's other characters, he seems to try and grow without letting the readers have a foundation. I've started book two, and can say honestly that King's growth as an author is evident.
good booke for good people I read this book over the last week and it was the best book i have read in a long time. If you like to read then you would like this book, The story and the way Stephen king writes just makes you want to keep turing the page. This book is a good read for teenagers and adults.
Not that great, but an intro to a great series To be honest, I almost gave up on the first book in the Dark Tower series. It just wasn't worth it. However, they told me to persist, and I would be rewarded, and it turns out that "they" were right. I'm almost done with the second book right now, and it's much better. Now, as for the first book: PROs: + It's short + Necessary intro to a great series + Roland's actually a pretty cool protagonist, even in the first book, and the "man in black" is a pretty cool villain + Gets better as it goes--the last section is really interesting CONs: - Starts off slow - The language King uses is ridiculous, especially his use of similies. This is supposed to be a serious tale, but his writing made me laugh out loud at it's sheer badness. For example: The gunslinger is apparently skilled at reloading his weapons on the fly. So how is his reloading "trick" described? "...and still the hands did their business, like overeager dogs that want to do their rolling-over trick for you not once or twice but all night..." The gunslinger's water skin is "...like a bloated sausage." You get the idea. - The supporting characters seem to follow a logic of their own. *SPOILER* For instance: A barmaid is describing a resurrection the man in black did in her town. A man dies of drug overdose, and the man in black raises him. So what does the barmaid do? She freaks out, runs to her room, locks the door, cries, laughs hysterically, comes back down stairs, and starts talking to the re-raised man as if nothing had happened. Puh-lease! *END SPOILER* Bottom line: The other books are good! Honest! Slam through this 300-page monstrosity, and move on to "The Drawing of the Three".
An incredable story that no King fan should pass up I am very late to start reading this series but I am glad that I am reading it. I finished this book in only one day which is a rarity for me, but this book is so well written that I could not help myself. I am very excited to keep reading the remaining books to this series, and I also cannot wait for the movie version of this to come out.
Interesting early work This is one of King's first works and shows a little less polish and direction than some of his later works. In particular he became more direct about spelling out the bad news and building the creepy feeling. I do not intend to sound negative, I am very pleased that I read the book and immediately ordered the rest of the series.
A so-so start to a great series This book was one of King's first, written his senior year of college and it has all the flaws of a budding novelist. The language is sometimes verbose and the imagery is a bit abstract, but all in all this is a good first chapter to the Dark Tower Series and a must read, if only for Walter's diatribe at the end of the book.
The Gunslinger The Gunslinger is an excellent introduction to a series that will surely be a classic. The Gunslinger flows smoothly and captures your interest from the start. Don't expect all your questions to be answered by the end of the book! There's six more to follow it for that! This book Should be 5 out of five stars.
Great Story I am a big Stephen King/Richard Bachman fan from way back when. I love his Gunslinger series. Of course you may not want to take my critique too seriously, because I just think that this author just can't go wrong. Even his early stuff was good and he has just gotten better and better at his craft.
Great Start to the Series I'm glad I jumped on the "Dark Tower" bandwagon! The first installment of the series is a bit basic and slow at times, but it's quite good considering King was 19 when he wrote it. Don't be put off by anything here; just keep reading and the series will take off like a rocket in Part II.
not the greatest start of a series Admittedly, the only reason I was initially interested in reading the Dark Tower series was the alleged inspiration it provided for the minds behind the television show, Lost (yes, I am a huge Lost fan). At the end of this first book in the series, I can't say I see much of a connection with the television show - although the show is only halfway through its run at the time of my reading the book - except for some references to space and time. But that doesn't mean this book was a waste. Keep in mind, King was only in his early 20s when he wrote The Gunslinger, and it is not a literary masterpiece in itself (a grown, wiser King even offers something of an apology in the book's foreword). Even so, it is highly imaginative and has its own set of mythology - quite a feat for a first novel. I'm not personally a fan of "Westerns". Ordinarily, a scenery of dry and cracked deserts, ragtime saloons, and pistol-wielding cowboys would have me reaching for the phone book to read instead. But King adds just enough magic, original folklore, and elements of supernatural to keep me turning the pages. I did get slightly bored at times, but my curiosity over the "big picture" motivated me to read on. Roland of Gilead, the last of the gunslingers, is on a quest to catch the elusive evil mage, the Man in Black (who shot a man in Reno...just kidding). Roland journeys toward the Dark Tower, a sort of nexus of space and time (it seems), always a step behind the Man in Black. Along the way, he meets Jake, a young boy who died in the world/time we know and somehow ended up in that of Roland's. [Note: the grisly description of Jake's worldly death does affirm that King is certainly a horror writer at heart.] The journey takes them on a treacherous path through desert and mountains, and through their shared experience they form a familial bond that is tested in a final confrontation with the Man in Black. The Gunslinger leaves much to be explained and accounted for, and almost seems to serve as a prologue for the series. Much of the novel takes place through Roland's recollections - stories of him on the path to finding the Man in Black - and serves to reveal less about the overall plot and more about Roland's character. My impression is that this series will make use of the slow reveal, layering questions upon mysteries until the final chapter. Maybe it does have something in common with Lost, after all! Overall, the story isn't exceptionally interesting or well-written, but it did plant the seed of curiosity that makes me want to know more. I will be reading, at the very least, Book 2 of the series.
Must Read Series Roland is the last living member of a knightly order known as gunslingers. The world he lives in is quite different from our own, yet it bears striking similarities to it. Politically organized along the lines of a feudal society, it shares technological and social characteristics with the American Old West, as well as bearing magical powers and the relics of a highly advanced, but long vanished, society. Roland's quest is to find the Dark Tower, a fabled building said to either be, or be located at, the nexus of all universes. Roland's world is said to have "moved on," and indeed it appears to be coming apart at the seams -- mighty nations are being torn apart by war, entire cities and regions vanish from the face of the earth without a trace, time does not flow in an orderly fashion; even the sun sometimes rises in the north and sets in the east. As the series opens, Roland's motives, goals, and even his age are unclear, though later installments shed light on these mysteries. This series was mostly inspired by the epic poem "Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came" by Robert Browning, the full text of which was included in an appendix to the final volume. In the preface to the revised 2003 edition of The Gunslinger, King also identifies The Lord of the Rings, the Arthurian Legend, and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly as inspirations. He identifies Clint Eastwood's "Man with No Name" character as one of the major inspirations for Roland. King's style of location names in the series, such as Mid-World, and his development of a unique language abstract to our own, are also influenced by J. R. R. Tolkien's work. The Dark Tower is often described in the novels as a real structure, and also as a metaphor. Part of Roland's fictional quest lies in discovering the true nature of the Tower. The series incorporates themes from multiple genres, including fantasy fiction, science fantasy, horror, and western elements. King has described the series as his magnum opus; beside the seven novels that comprise the series proper, many of his other books are related to the story, introducing concepts and characters that come into play as the series progresses.
That doesn't mean good, it means he has written things that have ... King is popular. That doesn't mean good, it means he has written things that have sold. He is the McDonald's (Micky Deees by him!) of literature, and this series is his Big Mac. In this series he makes big with the numbers 19 and 99, so I will make big with 7. It is seven novels. There are seven ingredients in a Big Mac - 2 all beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame seed bun. Like Micky Deees, he is everywhere, not that good, cheap, fast, and ok in a pinch when you have nothing else. He would make that sound cosmic, and lots are buying it. Verbose is not good on its own. I will say it has extra cheese. As a fantasy series compared to good ones, this does not rank. It is not bad (well it does get there in a few places). Just not good. I like it better than his horror stories, so if you could read those and like them, you would like these. Otherwise pass. King thought this was his Gormenghast or Lord of the RIngs. It is his McLean Deluxe that just didn't work out.
This was great to hear before the new revision. This is more than likely the one that disapeared from site read by Frank Muller Original version before revision & so the picture so idiot posted is wrong, that's the new revision that you can still buy not this one. Please fix site info so there's not confusion. I wish you still sold this.
Classy I stumbled across this book...Looked interesting enough, so I bought it. At first I had doubts, it starts a little slow, but soon found my eyes addicted to its pages. Get this first of four books, read 'em all, they're awsome.
I was just too bored... So, I'm giving The Gunslinger the literal, Goodreads version of two stars which means "it was ok". And it was, for the most part. I'm just not into Westerns (and The Dark Tower is sort of a Western), but I am into Stephen King (hence why I even picked up The Gunslinger). But, my God, 219 pages have never seemed so long to me (I'm not counting the Afterword since King's are always amusing). I really couldn't bring myself to care about the book. I only started caring about the book about forty pages before the end. Before that, I just liked the relationship between Roland and Jake (one big reason why I kept reading). I was just so bored throughout most of The Gunslinger. Boredom caused by reading rarely happens to me, but when it does, it really becomes the death of the book and most of the time if it's a series, I don't bother picking up the next installment (as the Mistress of the Art of Death sequel knows too well) and that's if I even finish the first installment. However, I did finish The Gunslinger so that has to count for something, right? Granted, had I not owned books 2-6 of The Dark Tower series, I probably would've put The Gunslinger down unread and readily swappable. Another reason why I finished this (which ties into the first reason) is because I've heard a lot of people comment on the fact that The Drawing of the Three (the second book in The Dark Tower series) is infinitely better than the first installment. In fact, I've heard of some people who disliked The Gunslinger yet loved the rest of the series. So, maybe I have to plod through the first part (which left me less than impressed) to get through the awesomeness that is the rest of the series. Here's to hoping that's the case.
Meh Overall, I was disappointed with this book. It was not at all what I was expecting. I nearly sent it to my "did not finish" bookshelf on GoodReads several times. But the ending almost made up for the work spent on the rest of the book. I hear the rest of the series is better, so I'll probably continue on. Later. Much later. One thing I found frustrating was the usage of words that I'd not seen before. And neither had my Kindle dictionary. And I couldn't find them on a Google search either. There were about a half dozen of them. For example, buckas. In the context, I would assume it was slang for buckboards.
Pretty darn good. I'm no King fanatic. I do have a lot of respect for the writer. I loved The Stand when I was a teenager. I enjoyed 'Salem's Lot in my mid twenties, HATED Pet Semetary, Loathed The Tommyknockers, have never really been able to get into It, but thoroughly enjoyed On Writing. Pet Semetary kept me away from King's books for quite a while. The Gunslinger brought me back, though. I had read it once before in High School, and liked it. Having read it just recently (and in a few days which is SUPERFAST for me) I can tell you that this book is AMAZING. The book is a testament to King's talent for showing us the Wizard behind the curtain. He not only draws the curtain for us, but he shows us all the things that people do not want to talk about. He points out all of our (society's) dirty little secrets. This novel also showcases the man's sheer brilliance for creativity. There are several things in the world of the Gunslinger that are familiar to the reader, but the world itself is not quite ours. I can honestly say that I have never read a book quite like this, and enjoyed it so much. I can't remember the last time I read a book so fast. If I had to make a complaint, I would argue that the ending slowed down and was a bit of a let down. However, I am already 200 pages into The Drawing of the Three (the sequel) and loving it. I have heard that the series goes downhill later on, and that is not an encouraging thought. For now, I will continue reading and enjoying these books until they are no longer interesting to me. Give them a shot!
I quit! I am half way through the fourth book in this series and I am soooooooooo bored with the pace of all of it. I believe that the whole of the seven could have been done in at most three books. I am giving up on Roland and all of his cohorts. Stephen King should stick to what he does best!
Not up to par I'm stunned that this poorly written book could have been written by Stephen King , and also that it has so many good reviews . He uses many obscure words where common ones would do just as well . I had to go to the dictionary section many , many times and some of those words weren't even in the dictionary . What is the point of that ? This book was long and drawn out and could have been written in a hundred pages as very little actually happens in it . I've read and enjoyed many of his works and was looking forward to the others in this series , but after this one , I can see no reason to move on to book two . I'm very disappointed !
It's not as boring as most of his books are. +AH4-After reading this book, you'll DEFINITELY want to read the continuences. This was a good book--very amuseing and Stephen King has good writing techniques. I hope you'll enjoy this book as much as I did.+AH4-
wow I'd always wanted to read some Stephen King, but I scare far too easily. A friend suggested this, and I was instantly hooked! I'm not usually a fast reader, but I finished this in one weekend...One of my fav's now!
Top-Notch King! Excellent kick-off to this great series, with wonderful artwork. The only other guy as scary as King these days is John Robert Marlow (author of NANO). If you haven't yet read the Dark Tower Series, start now!
I love the added illustrations I've read all 7 copies, but reading it on my Kindle gave me a whole new experience! I love the added illustrations! I'm having a great time the 2nd time around! Corinne Pittsburgh, PA
Enthralling! I am an avid Stephen King reader. Finally after years of hearing about Roland's journey, I decided to begin it for myself. I am glad I did. King's prologue however was my favorite part of the story.
Best King books ever! Second time for me reading the Dark Tower books and they are still a non-stop, can't put it down read. A very grown-up mystical world that makes you feel like your there traveling along with Roland!
Masterpiece This is Stephen King before he was the factory Stephen King. It starts slow, but you can't stop. Dark Tower is his masterpiece, and this is the introduction to a great series. You won't be sorry.
King's "Dark Tower" is absolutely enchantinng. The story of Roland is the foundation for King's dark realm. King spins his usual magic... even the forward is captivating. If you loved "The Stand" this series will leave you spellbound.
Great start to a great series This is one of those books that you read first, then read again after the last one of the series. There are some gems hidden in here that explain things that happen in later books, so ken it well.
Captivating, unique story Read a little slow to begin with and was confusing at parts, but once the story had you, it HAD you. Stephen King always crafts his story's intimately for the reader and I can't thank him enough.
A Book Review. Some of the characters language is crude, I kind of understand what the author is trying to do in his story telling. You just have to stop reading give yourself a break from reading this series.
just wasn't for me I have friends who absolutely loved the whole series, others who were so-so, but got caught up in it. It didn't grab me enough to commit to all 7, so i stopped here. Just not my thing i guess.
Good Read I have always enjoyed Stephen King 's writings and his ideas do give you something to think about. I am rereading the series because of the new book and it's just as good as the first time.
Good intro to the series This is obviously the first in a series. King has to introduce the characters and establish a history. I expect the next books to move a bit faster. I enjoyed this one as an intro to the series.
Second go around cant wait for movie Great book. One of kings best it and talisman go hand in hand along with black house Almost finished seventh book had to go back and re read the entire series because I don't want it to end
a great book, great story read the book series as a kid and rereading it now picking up the details I forgot making the series still seem new and different. this series is only something that stephen's dreams can create.
Requested Obviously King's thoughts in 1977. Catches your interest to read the next sequel, but didn't keep me glued. Ordered mainly for my wife , an avid King fan. Recommended for insomniacs.
The beginning This was unlike any Stephen King book I've ever read, I knew that going into it. It was a good introduction to the series it picked up steam and speed at the end. I'm excited for the next book.
the start of something amazing The dark tower series is a real reading of the evolution of the author. It shows how what's important changes. This book is a book of youth and sets the stage for greater things to come. Enjoy.
This is the only book in the series that took ... This is the only book in the series that took me a while to get through, but trust me, get through it. The other books are outstanding but you definitely need this book to give you background.
Too Choppy The story bounced around a lot with little to no purpose. Even the climax was a bit anti-climatic. I'm not really sure why so many people loved this series. Maybe it gets better in later books.
My impression Very f last read some themes are shared by earlier books but entertaining writting reviews with mandating the length of the review is annoying because of that I w will not review another book
Loved this book Loved this book, read it before coming back to the series several years later. I wish the rest of the story was as good as the first three books, to me the end of the series/story was just OK.
So far I've read first two books in the Dark ... So far I've read first two books in the Dark Tower series and I keep wanting to get to the Dark Tower, or know more about it story wise. However, there is enough action to keep me interested.
surprising It started out slowly, and I really didn't care for the characters. Three quarters through the book it started to feel like a real story. Maybe I'll check out the next volume from the library.
Although Stephen King is a great Author and I have tremendous respect for him I must have ADD, because I could not keep focus with the characters in this book. Although Stephen King is a great Author and I have tremendous respect for him, I just didn't like this book.
Amazing book! Ones of Stephen Kings best! Stephen Kings science-fiction fantasy book is one of the best I've ever read. I would highly recommend this the fans of Stephen King and anyone else who likes the science-fiction and fantasy.
An epic begins I've read this title for the fifth time and still I get the same "magical doorway" I found in the first reading. This started with 'Eyes of the Dragon.' I'm glad Mr.King has seen it through.
Great I found the book to be slow at parts but that is how all great stories begin, Roland seems to be one of the most powerful people in the story. I can't wait to read how he retrieves the thre
My First Steven King Book I'm 15 only months away from being 16 and I'm not quite the reader. This book, however, got me incredibly hyped for such a story that was hard to follow. I'm definitely buying the next one.
Start of a great series This short book is the start of Mr. King's Dark Tower series. While this book is heavy on background, it was still an enjoyable read for me. This book sets up the whole series quite nicely.
hmmm I will press on through the series. The first half of the story was slow and awkward, but it really picked up towards the end. And suddenly I wanted to see it evolve through all the books.
Vee's Views I have read most of Stephen Kings books and as with the majority of his books, they are certainly unique and you never know what to expect. Am on Dark Tower 2 at the moment and loving it.
Great book. A must read! Excellent start to the series that leaves you wanting more. Roland's journey already well on it's way in this first book that leaves you wanting to know the rest of his tale.
Great I finished reading all seven a couple of weeks ago. After such a long wait I felt I had to read them again. I think it is better this time. Although this is like the fourth for this one.
Too improvised I was curious of Stephen King's writing but none of this made much sense to me. It feels like he just made things up as he went and the universe in which it takes place is so undefined.
interesting but so very removed and out of sorts I enjoyed but it was an effort on my part to get through, driven by the promise of what could be.... This was not an easy read. It grows on you though. We'll see, the jury is still out.
Found it confusing Though he sort of wrapped it up cleanly in the end, the initial confusion lasted too long if you ask me. After the end I'm still unsure on a lot. Not sure if I'm ready for the other six
Enough to get me to read the next one ... but barely. In this book a "gunslinger" follows a man in black across the desert. We learn a bit about his past, and that there has been some sort of time disturbance. There are mutants and other strange things and a "Dark Tower" that has something to do with the gunslinger's destiny. I liked the book and I'll read the next one, but I would have preferred that it provide more information about the scope of the series or what the larger plot is. As it is I was left feeling that I had been led on and ultimately not quite rewarded. Also, while the gunslinger is an intriguing character, I was surprised that King didn't develop him better in this first book. The reader learns enough about how he is, and about what made him that way - but we don't learn much about how he "feels" or what his personality is like - unless he is in fact a automaton without much in the way of personality or feelings, which may turn out to be the case. So, I'll read the next one, but if it leaves me feeling the same way I won't read the 3rd in the series.
The Dark Tower 1: S K has long had an other worldly touch with our language. The Gunslinger just proves he has always had a foot in a twisted yet fascinating other world. We should all have such vision!
Good read, old but unique I enjoyed the book as it was full of fore shadowing(indicating a full fantasy universe I can get lost in) and didn't follow the usual perfect hero template in most fantasy genre books.
Best author ever Stephen king captures his characters and makes them seem as real as the person sitting next to you. Enjoy this series it's my second time around and its as good if not better this time
A GREAT stew If you like to read good Drama, Fantasy, Western, Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi or even Romance novels then you can't miss if you read this series as King finds a way to mix a great stew.
Another good book Once again I was up til dawn reading. Stephen King has a way of captivating you that keeps you reading way past the time when you should turn in for the night. Keep up the good work.
Thoroughly enjoyed this story Thoroughly enjoyed this. Can't wait to read book 2. I do not want to give any spoilers but I was disappointed with the end of the journey. Why do we have to have at least 20 words?
Chasing a dark tower? I think Ka dictates who reads this series or not, so I dont see the point in trying to make a persuading argument for or against. There will be water, if God wills it, do ya kennit?
Epic journey I have finally decided to start this series since the movie is coming out. I couldn't put it down; kicking myself for not starting it years ago. Can't wait to start the next book.
Very riveting Print is perfect, not too small, not too big. No idea why anyone would pay more for a fancier copy when this one does the trick. Perfect condition. Shipped quickly, arrived on time.
The Gunslinger Roland of Gilead Roland the gunslinger is an unforgettable protagonist and my favorite among all of Stephen King's characters. I have read the entire series 6 times. I love it. It never gets old!
Great "intro" book for what I hope is a great series This was only a 7/10, but I'll be giving #2 a shot because of the fandom. A sweeping, captivating, dynamic introduction to the character of The Gunslinger and his perilous journey.
Slow and Steady interesting book but I didn't get drawn in enough to want to get the next book in the series. but that is not to say I wont eventually get it. It was just a bit slow paced for me.
The Gunslinger Stephen King's Dark Tower series is one of his best. I have read this several times and each time is a new experience. The blending of fantasy and reality create a fabulous story.
good stuff I have read this book like three times now and I really enjoy it but it is the whole series that is really good even though Steven King seems kinda pompous by the end of the book
excellent book I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I had taken a but of a break from novel reading over the last while but I certainly think this series is an amazing way of coming off of my break!
First King book I have read It was very different from what I have read before. I like scifi and it seems like a good mix and is growing on me. I will get the next one and see if I want to continue reading.
Great Storytelling... ...Poor story. Stephen King is one of the better story tellers of our time. His plots, however, are often times lacking. He can take you to the end of a book without a clear story line, entertaining you all the way, but then drops you off wondering where you are and what just happened. I would recommend getting through this book (and it does have its moments) so that you can get into the middle of the series, where most of the meat of The Dark Tower is. If you have a lot of time to devote and don't mind reading 300+ pages (especially later on) with absolutely no advancement in plot but enjoyable story telling, then go for it. Otherwise you may want to stick with something more solid or less lengthy.
A good book to a greater series This book is not only good on its own, but it is a door to a much greater purpose, one that is eye opening and much greater in size. A fantastic read and a truly wonderful story
One of Stephen King's best I just love this story! I read it years ago in hard cover and just re-read it again on my Kindle. I had forgotten about most of the story and now I'm hooked on the series again!
brilliant first salvo World building on a concise scale. Excellent characterization, a surprising lack of cliche. Anticipating book two. I hope the excellent work is sustained throughout the series.
Great stuff! Can you believe my library didn't carry this book?! I read it years ago and wanted to reread so I could finally finish the whole saga. This is the Stephen King I really love.
Great beginning for a series I was captivated from the beginning of the book and I can't wait to read the rest of the series. It is a great intro into another world that one can easily get happily lost in
One of my favorite books Hands-down the best book series ever. Stephen King's epic saga combines elements of almost every story ever told then weaves them masterfully into the tale of Roland of Gilead.
More Questions than answers I can't say it doesn't make it hard to put it down - I kept coming back, even though the more I read the more confused the world King builds becomes. Worth the money at least.
Not his best, but I am holding on to his promise ... Not his best, but I am holding on to his promise that the series would be worth it. I still think King is a PHENOMENAL author with better character development than any other.
Trippy and good It's a weird book. I don't really understand what's going on or why, but at the same time it's a really good read. I especially like the not clear who is the good guy/bad guy.
