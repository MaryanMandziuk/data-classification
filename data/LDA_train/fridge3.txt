Great product It looks great, is the perfect size, and it isn't too loud at all. There weren't any problems with the shipping, and it even arrived earlier than expected. So far my brother loves it! Thank you!
Too loud The fridge is cold, but much too loud for any environment where someone requires silence and needs to concentrate, such as an office. I have another unit in the same office that is silent in comparison.
Four Stars It is working perfectly good. I like it
Four Stars i don't complain. just what i expected
Five Stars Perfect for what I needed Thanks
Loving it. Works without a problem. Loving it. Works without a problem.
BE ADVISED - NO INDOOR LIGHT This came in 2 big cardboard boxes but still had a ding at the side which I complained about. It was all setup. The box has the name of the company and clearly shows this is a Refrigerator which I did not like. I had to wait to clean it before I plugged it in... so its been quite a few days since it arrived and I put it on last night. Its best to wait 24 hours before putting in food as stated in the Manual. I put a few bottles of water into the Fridge after 16-17 hours. I checked on them and they seem cold enough and my temp is on Medium. I find that the door is not easy to open with one hand. It could be a possibility that the fridge needs to be higher and the carpet could be getting in the way so I will need to look into this. I have to put one hand on the top and then use the other hand to open the door. I do have the Fridge on a piece of cardboard so it doesn't leave a heavy imprint on the carpet. There is no light inside the Fridge... WHY?? I did not even pay attention to this until I opened the Fridge this morning and realized no light came on. I think all Refrigerators should have a light by default. So far I don't really have anything else to say apart from the fact its gone $20 cheaper since I purchased it... :-(
Good but noisy. It works great but does make noise.

Still - an appliance like this should last at least 4 or 5 years Broke down after 1 year. Inside is awkwardly shaped. It gets two stars instead of 1 because its so cheap, I didn't expect much. Still - an appliance like this should last at least 4 or 5 years...
This product is fine if you donâ€™t have to sit next to it This product is fine if you donâ€™t have to sit next to it , even 15â€™ away I can clearly hear it working. It is driving me crazy and I need to return it except I disposed the container it came in.

Buyer Beware I had this sitting in my office for 3 months prior to plugging it in. Once I had a use for it, I plugged it in and it did not work. When I went to an appliance repair shop, I was told to throw it away...it would cost more to repair than to buy a new one.
Five Stars good
Four Stars Good

Love this fridge Nice
Five Stars gift
Not bad Works well. However it doesn't have a light on the interior when you open the door. I assumed it would but that due to a lack of research.
Happy!! Perfect size for my son who wanted cold beverages by his bed. Awesome price as well. So happy I purchased it for his birthday.
Nice Beer Fridge at $149 So far, so good! Keeps my beer COLD!!! Delivered without a dent or a scratch. 4 months & counting. Good price at $149.
Five Stars Great fridge
Great Little fridge Great Little fridge. Looks and runs great. We use it for our deck outside to keep drinks cold in the summer.
Not very recommended. A little bit noisy. I can clearly hear the sound of flowing liquid and mechanical noise especially during night. Not very recommended.
Awesome Product Direct cool system. a good product. Working absolutely fine and giving good service. Highly recommended.
stinky works ok and yes it arrived with damage a dent in the frontvand side also it stinks inside
Love this quiet fridge- stays ver cold Works perfect- well with the price
Five Stars Works great and very quiet. Plenty of room for all the items I store. I'm happy with it.
Great sized fridge for the price Great sized fridge for the price. It arrived a day before its scheduled delivery, however, there are quite a few dents and dings on the front door, which are noticeable in the sunlight. Didn't feel like dealing with the hassle of returning and waiting on a new one especially during the holiday season, so I'll be keeping it.
Not too big. Not too small. Perfect for a room or office. We put half gallon cartons on the door. No problems yet!
Five Stars How much can you say about a refrigerator except that it keeps things cold. Bravo!
Five Stars On the lowest settings, still keeps all my foods/drinks cold and not noisy at all!
Four Stars Perfect little boat fridge. The freezer is kinda silly though since its so small
perfect for a work water fridge it's quiet and fits under the desk at work. perfect for a work water fridge.
great product! Solved many problems... great product! Now I can store extra food at work.
Five Stars Would work better if it came with food and drink already in it. :-)

Five Stars Great fridge! Great quality!
Five Stars works good for my office
Not suitable for countertop use The description made me think this was going to be far smaller than it actually is; it's not suitable for countertop use, which is what I wanted it for. It's also quite loud.
Five Stars Kid loves it
Five Stars A very nice fridge, love it!
I bought a different brand not from Amazon and I'm much happier with it I had to return it because it makes so much gurgling noise and it's by my desk at the office. Too distracting. I bought a different brand not from Amazon and I'm much happier with it.
Four Stars Nice
Just what I wanted Works great and for here a day early. It's been a month and I have no frost in the freZer unit, but it froze a juice box
Four Stars Haven't used it yet but it is ice and no damages
Five Stars Good
Five Stars great product
Five Stars Great product
Five Stars I LIKE
Five Stars God
Disappointing Hated it, only because it makes an annoying pop noise whenever motor shuts off, most people probably woundnt care. Other than that it worked great.
Four Stars We wound up returning this - didn't realize it was a fridge, not a freezer.
Not that good Loud, quite small, doesn't fit a lot of stuff
Five Stars Its awesome.
Most devices are rated in watts. All your products ... Most devices are rated in watts. All your products electric, or electronics should state wattage so people can understand power consumption of the device. I won't buy unless I know the wattage.
Concidering Having Had This Unit For Some Time... Here Is ' The Skinny ' OK. It Has Quite A Pleasing Appearance. But When The Condenser Is Running , Which Most Of The Time, You Will Be Quite A Wear Of It. Also My Unit I Felt Required Supplemental Assist, For Complete/Sealed Door Closure. I Also Have a Fan On It To Optimize In The Heat Transfer Process, Help with That Run Time Issue/ Quite Warm Enclosure... Well The Good Thing, If It Is Of Any Consequence ... It Is Affordable.
Three Stars still deciding
Not so cool.... I was hoping to keep about $200 worth of rats for my snakes in this thing. From what I read I thought you could use it as a freezer or a fridge but it is mainly just a fridge. It has a very small area for a freezer.... you might be able to put a popsickle or two in it. I put it to it's highest setting and took the freezer door off and it said 31F so I thought GREAT! Nope. I had the rats in it for a few days now and some of them thawed due to the un-even temperature. My findings are if you want something to keep non perishable items in such as soda cans this may work. For everything else I would not trust it one bit with it's uneven flow of temps. The rats and mice towards the front were still cold and hard but towards the back and bottom had thawed. Thankfully I am sure they can be refrozen due to it still being cold, only a few days have passed and I am feeding them to snakes. Do not be mislead by any thoughts of this thing reaching enough low temps to freeze or keep ice etc.
One Star SMALL LIKE MY HAND
Five Stars Perfect size
functional mini fridge Great mini fridge, its mini but still so functional like a normal sized fridge.
Five Stars Almost completely silent and just big enough for a collage student. 10/10 would buy again
Five Stars just as expected
Great little fridge Gets super cold Holds so much more than I ever expected!
LOVE my little fridge!!! It cools extremely well and quite quickly! The little freezer compartment really does freeze a few things I have tried so far...homemade pancakes, waffles, few pieces of bread, and small kid's ice/gel packs. It's not even turned up as high as I expected to have to set it in the beginning. Usually keep it at about half way, unless I am in and out a lot. I bought it to take to the church I work at, in my nursery class, since I work all three service times on Sundays as well as Wed nights and special events. I don't have to starve now. It fits so well in the cabinets under the counter. Very quiet too! I would most definitely recommend it to anyone! Considering ordering another for our basement at home.. I'm a Very happy customer!
Five Stars Surprisingly quiet.
The fridge itself is nice, and works well so far The fridge itself is nice, and works well so far. It arrived with damage on the back left side, which is why I give it 3 stars. I put it in a slot between two cabinets so the damage can't be seen. So as long as it's functioning, I'm okay with it. I'll update if quits early, possibly due to the shipping damage.
Door opening reversal My problem is that there aren't any instructions on how to reverse the door opening.
Five Stars Nice size - works well - great price.
Great so far just took it out of the box Shipped early. No damage on delivery, only minor surface scratches on the top but very difficult to see. Only 20 minutes plugged in and already cold (the temperature dial was on medium). So excited and I love the finish thank you! Also super quiet so far, something I needed this fridge to be:D
Just OK Silent for the first couple of weeks, now starting to make more noise. Keeps things very cold.
Well I like it but it has several dents in one side-one ... Well I like it but it has several dents in one side-one big one /where outer coating is coming off! Also I just noticed price is reduced-I will keep it if you will give me a credit on difference in new price-otherwise I want to return it! I'm very upset about this!
Nice fridge but noisy Nice fridge but a little noisy. Its in my office so the noise is no worse than the other machines. But I wouldnt place it in an area where you sleep. Made well, very handsome. Works well
