Five Stars I love mine 😍😍
Perfect mini fridge! Love it!!! My office is pretty small (maybe 8x8) so it sits a foot from me - under my desk. Noise was really a concern for me so I was happy to see it's REALLY quiet and keeps my food perfectly chilled. Definitely a good buy!
Great product Small penny size dent but everything works fine and comes with a 1 year warranty. I was happy to get it and im happy now. I love it!! Its bigger than i thought. It has a lot of room in it
Works great, fits a lot of stuff Works great, fits a lot of stuff, and is silent. We don't hear it cutting on and off and it is currently being used in a small bedroom. Great product.
Cold, fantastic, best fridge This product deserve 10 stars. This fridge is cold, perfect size for my office.
Awesome Product Direct cool system. a good product. Working absolutely fine and giving good service. Highly recommended.
I really like it. Perfect size for my office & fits ... I really like it. Perfect size for my office & fits under my desk. Super quiet & fits a lot of stuff.
Satisfied - Price is right! When I received the refrigerator I was first very pleased with the look..clean, shiny, and had no scratches or dents. The weight of this unit made install (alone) a breeze. I was also pleased with how much I was able to stock in the unit; significantly more than my old one which is the same size. You basically can't even hear this unit running, so that is nice. Lastly, after two weeks of using the unit daily, I have found that the temperature is very even within. Really no complaints here!
Buyer be Warned! I noticed this refrigerator was off about a month ago. Plugged in, with power, and thermostat set for cold. I cleaned it out and plugged it back in and it ran fine. For 1 month. It was dead again this morning. It was new in December, 2014 and dead by April 2015. $112 in the trash.
So much more room than I expected I didn't have the highest expectations when purchasing this fridge. I just needed one and picked one that looked nice and had a large number of cubic feet in its description. I'm glad I did. This is a really nice fridge with plenty of space. Well worth the $150 I paid for it.
Disrete for its size, relatively quiet & sleek For small fridges noise is important because they are often used outside the kitchen (eg bedroom). This fridge makes low pitch, distant sounding noise during its cool cycle that does not bother sleeping. There is a dull click as the compressor kicks it but doubt it would bother anyone. Relatively quiet for vapor compression cycle fridge. I've used it for a month now so can't comment on longevity/durability except to say "works so far". Pro tip: Things near (below) the freezer drawer will freeze if cool setting is >5.
Great little fridge Great little fridge. I purchased this after tiring of the overcrowded and gross community fridge at work. This fridge is super quiet and efficient. I usually place a week or more of lunches and snacks as well as a half gallon of Almond milk with no issues. Happy I purchased.
Awesome fridge, very spacious Awesome fridge, very spacious. Door will hold two half gallons of milk, but you can easily fit multiple full gallons in the fridge. Freezer works very well and does freeze surrounding foods. I highly Recommend this fridge so far.
Five Stars Perfect size for bedroom. No noise.
Junk Well, I just finally opened up the box to plug it in under my new bar and although the packaging looks fine, the actual fridge is beat all to hell. There is not one side of it that doesn't have a dent in it. Now we're not talking about small dents, we're talking it looks like it's been hit with baseball bats. That being said, it also doesn't work..... I should've read the other reviews before purchasing because it looks like I'm not the only one with this unique experience.
Great refrigerator, but don't buy it for under-counter installation This is a very nice refrigerator. As others have noted, it is super quiet. My only disappointment is that I had hoped to install this under a counter, but upon opening the box (which by the way is nicely designed so that the refrigerator stays on the bottom but the top slides off) I noticed that it specifically states that the refrigerator is for free-standing installation only. In other words, not for installation under a counter. I had asked other reviewers if it could be installed under a counter, and they thought you could, but alas, you should not.
Great fridge, but came damaged, and it's a little loud. It works okay, the fridge itself is fine...it came damaged though. The corner of it has a huge dent and metal pulled back on it. I did read other reviews about theirs coming damaged, thought I would take a chance. The damage doesn't stop it from working...but still...
I am disappointed with the clearly poor The fridge itself functions decently, but it arrived with many dents and cracked plastic pieces. The fridge wobbles due to uneven feet. I am disappointed with the clearly poor, falling apart packaging resulting in a damaged product.
Just what I needed Purchased to use in my office. Decent size, runs very quiet but freezer does frost over fairly easy. Had some strawberries underneath and they froze over. Small plastic door on freezer also broke (small tab that let's it swing up and down). Not a deal breaker but something to keep in mind for others who purchase. Love it overall and would recommend
Be Cautious!!! We have had our fridge for a week. It's a great fridge, no problems with the fridge itself. However, my husband was wiping off the front of the fridge and a large (1 inch) piece of the emblem came off the fridge and became lodged in his hand. This sort of thing shouldn't happen and we'd like to make everyone aware of this injury.
Horrible.. I don't even know how to call this thing, but this thing at the back side of the fridge was already cut. It is still sitting in my room because the company asked me to mail the electric cord and stuff in terms of replacement, but I really dont have time for all that. I donno why I paid same amount of money as others and have to spend extra more time and money.
I bought t this product 7 months ago, it ... I bought t this product 7 months ago, it failed we had a 12 month warrant , I completed the required paperwork and never an acknowledgement from Midea America, why have a warrant if the company fails to honor it, shame on midea
Awesome mini fridge, but doesn't prevent people from stealing your drinks. I love this Mini Fridge! It's small enough to set on top of my dresser, but big enough for a bunch of can drinks, snacks and such. The freezer part is small, like most mini fridges, and if you stuff too much in it, they'll melt. I made that mistake when I tried to put too much ice cream in it. I got this so people in the house kept stealing all of my drinks from the main fridge, but honestly, this doesn't stop them. Now they just come in my room and steal them. It was really easy to set up, just take off the tape and plug it in. I turned the temp two numbers down from the coldest, which keeps it from freezing my drinks. I recommend not putting anything under/right next to the freezer that you don't want frozen, because it will freeze. Honestly, it should've been common sense, but I didn't realize it until my ham was frozen. Overall, I really like mini fridge and highly recommend it!
Perfect fridge for my wife to have at her workplace Perfect fridge for my wife to have at her workplace. She keeps it under her desk and it is very quite. Does what it is supposed to do and perfect size.
Unsatisfactory Delivery The refrigerator case was damaged by delivery. In addition, it seems no light inside?!
Great price, Great little fridge. great little fridge. If you set it to the coldest setting, you can use the top shelf under the ice tray compartment as a freezer. I have had other small refridgerators that did not stay very cold, and the ice tray compartment took forever to freeze ice. This one definitely stays cold and freezes ice fast. If I needed another small fridge, I would buy another one of these.
The size was perfect that it accommodates several bottles without it being too ... Was looking for a small fridge to put in my newborn's nursery so that I wouldn't have to stumble downstairs for a bottle in the middle of the night. The size was perfect that it accommodates several bottles without it being too large or conspicuous. This is a great little fridge for the room or dorm for some drinks you want to keep cool but it doesn't have the capacity to store anything large.
Nice, quiet little fridge with a few drawbacks to consider This is a great little fridge, but there are some significant minuses to consider which are considerable enough to keep it from a perfect rating. I needed it in order to survive a kitchen reno and it has really come in handy for that. Plus: + It's quiet! Even small refrigerators are notorious noise-makers, but this one makes only a subdued whirr when it runs. + It's not going to fit a ton of stuff, but it stores more than I thought. Minus: - Frost builds up very quickly on the freezer section. - The temperature is not even throughout the fridge. Items stored on the handy little tray under the freezer section tend to freeze, but if you set the temperature control lower to avoid this, the rest of the items in the fridge do get cold enough. - The room for tall standing items doesn't fit much more than a one quart carton of milk or one wine bottle. There is room for 2 bottles to be laid on their sides on the shelves, but the shelf space is lost.
5 stars because it smells like a chemical plant melted down I give this four stars because I can't give 3.5. I would have given 3.5 because it's large, works excellently at keeping food cold, and seems to freeze things put in the freezer, without too much frost. I would take away that missing 1.5 stars because it smells like a chemical plant melted down, every time I open the door to get food out. The plastic off-gasses a STRONG PVC smell that is so powerful it contaminates the mouths of bottles, and I can then smell that smell whenever I drink from a bottle I had in that fridge. Mmm mm mm, nothing quite as delicious as a bottle of ice cold water with the strong smell of potential cancer, with every sip. If you get this fridge, perhaps leaving the door open with it unplugged, for a month or a year might kill the smell, but I plugged it in immediately and started using it, right after opening the box.
Perfect size for my small apartment. This has come in very handy that I broke my leg and am stuck on the third floor and the kitchen is on the second. Makes healing a little easier when I do not have to go up and down the stairs as much.
Skip this one! The dimensions were incorrect (it says it is 17 inches wide, and it is more than 18 1/2) which makes it not fit in our cabinet opening, so it would have gone back from that alone. However, it took us MONTHS to receive this item. We kept getting "are you sure you want this item" emails, then we would be told of a delay…over and over! After we finally received the fridge, it arrived completely damaged! Very frustrating! There were holes in the box, and when we opened it up, we found there was only a very thin layer of styrofoam across the top of the refrigerate which was oddly scratched underneath, and there were two corner pieces that ran along half of the height of the door on both sides. It didn't seem to matter, because with all of the other areas completely unprotected, the worst damage was a huge dent on the door along the styrofoam. the back corner was also crushed and there were all kinds of small dents elsewhere. Do not order this due to there being no way it will arrive undamaged. The only thing protecting 99% of the fridge is a layer of cardboard. The bottom of the box is not connected by design and is not even taped on. The top of the box had one strip of tape across the top - no other tape holding the box closed anywhere! There was plastic strapping around the box, which was how the bottom stayed on. The fridge otherwise was fine. White wire shelves inside with a can chute/stacker in the door, and a tiny freezer compartment at the top. Nothing special - fine. Never turned it on or plugged it in. Sending it back - hope it won't be too much of a hassle (wish me luck :)
" I put many ice-creams and yogurts in it and all of them had gone bad. When I want to return the item DO NOT BUY IT!!!!!!! Only after 1 month I bought it, it doesn't work now. We did not move it and did not touch any part that "should not touch." I put many ice-creams and yogurts in it and all of them had gone bad. When I want to return the item, I see I can not return it without the original packing!!!! And I can't return it after one month. Don't buy it!!!
Great Little Refrigerator Keeps Everything Cold! I. purchased this as a gift for a 10 teacher unit that works with students who have learning disabilities. We have a hot cocoa corner and people were bringing in bottles of milk and leaving them there.to go bad, so I got this little refrigerator to make the cocoa corner more complete so we could have fresh milk for the cocoa, and students and teachers could store perishable foods there. It's the perfect size and has a little freezer in it as well. It's amazing how much can be fit into it! It works beautifully, never causes a problem with the electricity (we also have numerous computers and printers in the resource center) and keeps everything nice and cold. Even the storage space on the door was well thought out and designed with room for large bottles of drinks. I'd by this again if I had to make the choice all over.
Great Compact Fridge! Large Storage Capacity Great Fridge for the garage! Keeps drinks super cold (Which I like) Garage is not insulated. So far it has worked thru the entire summer and winter in outside environment. Meaning it is not being used indoors where it is climate controlled. I know I am taking a risk on increasing the chances of this fridge on failing but it has not yet. Storage: - Stores a lot of drink cans or bottles. - Can store 2 12 pack of cans or a 12 pack of beer bottles. (Will need to place them accordingly to fit) - It has nice small storage compartment for ice trays inside. Operation: - Runs very quite for a mini fridge. - Cold adjustment settings on back. Overall Verdict: Really like this fridge! Capable of storing a lot of drinks or food items. Very pleased with this product and its operation thus far.
Won't Stop Running Obnoxiously loud, constantly running and emits a pungent plastic-y smell when the fridge is turned off. Seriously, I used a stopwatch to determine the length between runs. Even on the lowest setting, this fridge ran every 16 minutes. On the default "3" setting, it ran every SIX minutes. I kept this thing in my bedroom, where I was frequently woken up by the sound of gurgling and buzzing. Terrible. Returned to Amazon for a refund.
For a Good Time, Get This Mini-Fridge I needed a mini fridge in my room because I'm too lazy to go downstairs where the kitchen is and was very thirsty for a cold drink! THis one in particular stood out to me because of its fair price and small size. The Good: --- It was lightweight so it didn't kill my back when I carried it upstairs all by myself. --- Sleek design that would look good in almost any room. --- Even when placed several feet away from my bed, it is fairly quiet and does not distract me from my beauty sleep. --- I don't have to go downstairs anymore. Ever. Again. The Bad: --- I mentioned that it is fairly quiet but it does make some minor whirring noises. Might keep the extremely light-sleepers awake. The Overall: --- Perfect if you're a lazy bastard such as myself that wants a good drink and the occasional frozen treat.
What I like about this refrigerator is that it is very quiet ... I purchased this product a month ago for my office because it met my size and cost demands. What I like about this refrigerator is that it is very quiet (almost undetectably quiet) and does not disturb conversations I am having with clients. Also, because it is black and not very deep, is fits well under my desk and is relatively unnoticeable. The materials used to build this product are not of great quality, but they serve their purpose. The refrigerator came slightly damaged (the back had a small crack due to shipping). Overall, I would recommend this product.
I works and I was able to change the direction the door opened fairly easily. This may be a refurbished fridge. When I took off the cardboard and styrofoam, I found the top was already scratched and dented and there were a bunch of dead gnats inside. The pegs that cover the screws are so flimsy that two out of three of them snapped rather than pulling up and out. Other than that, it's a fridge. I works and I was able to change the direction the door opened fairly easily.
Turns on just fine and makes all the right noises Turns on just fine and makes all the right noises. Does not work at all. Cools nothing. Too cumbersome to send back. Waste of money.
A small mini-fridge Compact and at a good price but so light-weight that you need to use both hands to open the door.
One Star The item arrived damaged. The door has a very noticeable dent.
No more running downstairs for late-night drinks! So far, we love it. We may have just lucked out but it is working great and we cannot hear a thing. In fact, when we first set it up, I was worried that it was not working. We couldn't hear a fan or compressor when we plugged it in, so I figured it was a dud. Instead, after 24 hours, it was nice and cold, as were the beverages in it. We'll see how it works out, but for now we couldn't be happier with it.
Followed all instructions on use including using a surge protector ... Followed all instructions on use including using a surge protector as well as letting the product sit for multiple days standing upright after sitting on its side. Only 20 days into usage the product simply stopped working.
My product - Midea WHS-87LWD1- Is Great and I believe It is same as ....87LB1. with a different surface finish. My product review from my Order page was redirected to this product, though the refrig I bought was the following model - Midea WHS-87LWD1 2.4 Cubic Foot Black with Wood Like Linish Single Door Compact Refrigerator. I believe the item I ordered is the same as this one, except mine has a wood-grain finish. Received item in great shape, no dents on the boxes (it was double boxed, with straps around the interior box, and the whole thing was very packaged by Midea. There was no Amazon packaging at all, on this.) The manual recommended letting it stand for 1/2 hr before use, but I let it stand 24 hours to let coolant settle (as I'd read on many refrig reviews. The manual also recommended that it cool for 2 hours before filling.) I have no complaints at all about this item - there were 5 five star reviews earlier, for this item, which made it the only compact refrig I found, with no negative feedback - but Amazon may have merged those into the item no. I mentioned earlier. It makes almost no sounds, slight low popping sound once in while. I've kept it slightly above Medium level which results in temp. of between 36-40, depending where I place thermometer. At this temp. ice cream is soft, but still ice cream, ie. not soupy. I'll post again when I buy some buy ice cream and increase the cooling setting. Only a few ice cream bar or pops could fit in freezer, though you could repackage your ice cream to fit it in. So far, I recommend it highly, especially at under $130. By the way the interior looks like that on the other model I mentioned above, though the finish is the wood grain here, and I think it looks cool, besides cooling well.
works great! I was pretty surprised at how well this little fridge worked out. You just can't beat the price. The fridge is quiet and gets cold quickly. We used it for a trade show and had no problems. It's very light weight and durable at the same time. Great for an office, gym, etc.
great minifridge I was concerned about ordering this fridge after a number of reviews noted damage during shipping. It seems like maybe the vendor took this feedback into account, because my fridge was very well packed in multiple layers of cardboard, as well as some Styrofoam. Definitely no damage. It's a great size, whisper quiet (I keep thinking that it is not on and checking it :-)). There is no real freezer, but the "chiller" compartment is cold enough to make ice cubes.
1st of all it was shipped super fast! 1st of all it was shipped super fast!! It was so easy to set up! No dings, dents or anything. When I turned it on... I had to go back and check to see if it was working, because I didn't hear a sound!! And yep... it was cold as ever within 30 minutes!! :-D Very spacious and roomy! The ice box is much bigger than it looks! Perfect for my health room!!
Refrigerator is 35 days old and IS NO LONGER WORKING ... Refrigerator is 35 days old and IS NO LONGER WORKING. I neglected to mail in the warranty so now I'm out of luck because it's more than 30 days since purchase. I will never purchase another one! Are you kidding me?
Watch out when ordering this item. I ordered BLACK ... Watch out when ordering this item. I ordered BLACK and got a WOOD colored door. The pictures do not always match. For example: select a particular size, and select a color. The size may change on you. Pay attention to the Medea model number. WD is wood. SS is stainless. WH is white.

Great Fridge, no lie that it is very quiet. Came with a very small dent or two, but that is to be expected due to shipping. The thing runs so quite, I didn't think it was working when I first plugged it in. I had to put my ear all the way to the back to hear it running. Cools great, the ice try freezes perfectly. All in all it was all it was advertised to be and more. Definitely recommend this fridge.
Great refrigerator! Fridge worked well. Better than the one I bought at Costco (can't remember the name but has tons of reviews and also sold on Amazon). This fridge held the temp between 34-39 degrees even with regular use. It was a temporary refrigerator when our full-sized fridge died and we had to wait for a new one to be delivered. Used it for 3 weeks and kept food cold (not just cool like some others). The freezer bin was nice for ice and hot dogs with room for a bit more. It was pretty quiet too. The main area is roomier than you'd think plus also allowed for taller items. The on-door storage was also bigger than others. We were able to fit 1/2 gallon milk and quart of OJ. Plus there are upper shelves on the door that fit yogurt. Very pleased with this purchase.
Great fridge Good quality, adequate space...just what I was looking for, for my spare room. The small freezer compartment is cold enough to make ice, without the fridge even being on the coldest setting. Two small bad things, it does make noise but what fridge doesn't? Also, if you put liquids in the refrigerator space right under the freezer compartment, they can freeze if they get too close.
I've had it one month now, So far, so good! I've had it about a month and is very good so far. Food stays very good cool and no cold spots. All around coolness is uniform and all food inside is cooled equally. It was pre-set at a temperature that is perfect, and I did not even have to adjust it. It is quiet for sure, and you can't hear it while it is running, unless you get real close to it. It has a little start up sound when it turn on, but that's about it. It arrived in excellent condition and was 'double packaged' for so it wouldn't get damaged.
Five Stars fits perfectly and works well
Keep cold beer nearby This is the third one of these I have had in the past 16 years. So, they have a useful life of 8 years outdoors but not in the elements. It sits under my Tiki Bar on my dock. It is covered by the Tiki Bar but still gets some weather but I take it in in the winter. The previous ones got tossed as the fridges lost their seal. It does a great job of keeping beer and soft drinks cold so I don't have to go back to the house for refreshment.
Works great. Happy with my purchase. This fridge works great! I've had it for almost a year and no problems. I've had it full to the max and all my beverages stay cold. I do keep it on a higher setting, because I like my liquids ice cold, however, the fridge is keeping up so far. I had no issues with damage during shipping. I recently moved and the fridge still works after being manhandled by the movers. I would say do not use this fridge as a built-in. It needs air to breathe, or it gets too warm on the sides.
Tall enough to be used as a table beside a ... Tall enough to be used as a table beside a chair. Virtually no freezer. Otherwise, a decent mini-fridge. Quiet.
Disappointed After I received it I was informed by the instruction sheet it was not to be placed in a garage or carport. This was where I wanted it to be. Don't buy it if you want it to be in an area not inside your building!
Noisy!! A nice little office refrigerator at a good price. I would not recommend for a space where noise is a detriment (i.e., a dorm room where you're trying to sleep) . The freezer is open in the back, making it merely adequate. Still, I don't regret the purchase, as it's in a room used sporadically. But it's loud...very loud.
Warning- Stops working after a few months. All these wonderful reviews are people that just received this fridge. I was THRILLED with it- $88 for the white fridge and it was very quiet! Then 4 months later it started making a loud annoying noise- it was no longer quiet. Then another month later it stopped working. Should have paid more for a higher quality one! If you want something long term, I don't recommend this!
Met All Expectations Delivered with manufacturers box inside another box for protection. Let the refrigerator settle and sit for proper amount of time per instructions prior to plugging into the electrical socket. It is very cold on medium setting and working great. Holds a case of tall necks on middle shelf. Great beverage fridge. That being said, I am very pleased with this item.
it is the best one I own I was hesitant being an unfamiliar name but, as it turns out, it is the best one I own. Love the way it does not freeze and explode the soda cans of soda that touch its insides.
decent Well, if "initial quality" or "first impressions" were the only thing that counted, this would be 2 stars or less. One of the screws holding the freezer compartment to the top of the unit had fallen out. The clip that holds the freezer compartment door wasn't attached, nor was there any mention of it in the directions. Both were easily fixed, but still, they shouldn't have been necessary on a brand new unit, regardless of the price. I don't think "all screws secured" is asking too much at any price point. The instruction manual is very poorly translated. Thankfully, you don't need it since it's, you know, a refrigerator. The part about when (and how) to defrost the unit was the only part I cared to read, and I could figure it out.
Perfect size Excellent fridge for home or office use. It's very useful for drinks and small food items. It's very quiet and it stays really cold. The size is perfect especially if your cubicle is limited in space.
Good bang for your buck I was surprised at the size of it when it arrived, as it was much larger than I anticipated. Since I am living in a very cramped college dorm, I do wish it was a bit smaller in size so I could fit it under my bed. Other than that, it's pretty decent and gets the job done. Is also pretty quiet compared to a lot of other fridges. Freezer is decent as well but very limited space, the real test of this fridge will be AFTER the winter...
I don't even know what's going on. Ghosts maybe. This fridge has a mysterious power. Whenever it kicks on the cooling it somehow disables my drawing tablet and pen for about 30 seconds. It's a nice fridge but this unintended side effect is very annoying.
Quiet, cold little fridge. Initially I was going to reverse the door but the manual said if the fridge gets tipped on its side for any period of time, you have to wait 24 hours to plug it in (as opposed to 3 or 4 hours). I don't know how important it is to actually follow that rule, but heck, it's my first mini-fridge and my priority was cold beverages. I got the 3.3 cubic foot. It deep and holds a lot. You can also remove the shelves which is handy. I love it so far. It's cold, and super quiet. It's in my office and I don't like a lot of noise when I'm working -- I don't notice it at all. I keep my dog's little icecream cups in the freezer for when he comes to hangout. Size-wise, the freezer could probably hold two frozen meals. I'm not usually one to buy a warranty but it was cheap and the reviews on its customer service were good so I figured 'what the hell.' With my luck, the fridge will break on day 366.
Five Stars Great product very happy with it
It would be a great little fridge if it didn't make so much noise ... It would be a great little fridge if it didn't make so much noise in the middle of the night! I am not normally disturbed by a little noise, but at 11 O'Clock at night it's making enough noise to wake up the devil, and that goes on for an hour or more! Would not suggest that you put it in your bedroom! Other than that, it works great and has enough space for anyone who doesn't need to store a lot in the fridge.
Direct cool system. a good product. Working absolutely fine and giving good service. Highly recommended. Direct cool system. a good product. Working absolutely fine and giving good service. Highly recommended.
Perfect Size Perfect size for gameroom where you want to have a stash of cold drinks at the ready. Enough shelf and door space for cans and water bottles. Freezer is big enough to store a few pints of ice cream. The black finish on the sides was slightly scuffed from the box but otherwise it's very solid and works well.

COLD!!! This little fridge far surpassed my expectations! It looks very nice in the stainless steel color. It fits well under my side desk in my office where space is at a premium. This little guy gets cold! I have to keep the setting under half the thermostat or the drinks will get so cold they partially freeze...the lunch meat on my sandwiches do if I leave them in there over night. This fridge is very quiet...rarely do I hear it running. This is a quality fridge for cheaper than a lot of other brands on Amazon!
Works OK. Good price. Delicate, broken freezer compartment hinge. Working fine for a few months now. Only problem is I have to defrost it manually each time. After 4 months I accidentally bumped the freezer compartment door and broke the flimzy hinge pin. Now I have to place a folded towel at the front of the freezer. Still, kinda worth it. I'd buy it again, but be a LOT more cautious of the poorly designed freezer compartment door hinge.
Good Value Fridge I purchased two units. Returned one immediately due to malfunction. Easy free return to Amazon, and new one arrived within 4 days. Consistent cooling and quiet, economical operation. Nice looking stainless front, black top and sides. We shall see about longevity. I have a smaller unit of the same brand that has operated for two years with no issues.
Good looking fridge I received this fridge about a week ago with no problems with shipping and the package had no damage. The unit was in perfect condition. Plugged it in and set it to coolest setting; it was slightly noisy during the cool down and does make more noise when cooling down after having the door open, but this is no louder than your kitchen fridge. Cooled down nicely. Bought this for a bar we built and it is underneath next to a wine fridge. I did give it the recommended clearance of 5 inches in the back and left side of fridge (I posted a picture). Fits most bears and soda bottles/cans with the right shelving adjustments. I would recommend.

VERY DISAPPOINTED. Not sure how the fridge works, but it's the second one our department has ordered and it came dented. VERY DISAPPOINTED.
Wouldn't recommend, read my review I don't think you could fit even one ice cube tray in the freezer department. Big bulge at bottom area takes up lotsa room. Look at photos of how they stack soda cans in there. One shelf removable. Hard to tell which side has handle. Wouldn't recommend.
great fridge! sometimes its soo quiet i dont know ... great fridge! sometimes its soo quiet i dont know if its on or not but only way i can tell is when i see that whatever is inside it is cold. the door is giving me some issues it wont close properly. and the engineering team that built it shouldve put some thought to the size of it also. on the top racks you can only fit like 5 or 6 soda cans (not sure to be exact how many)and than there is a minor space there for like half a soda can lol.. they shouldve either made it that half inch bigger or smaller. same thing with the cubbys when laying down the beer bottles. theres like 2 inches more space and a beer wont fit so makes it harder to stack up the beers properly. other than that its a great fridge quiet and keeps the stuff inside cold. (not icycold but cold)
High effeciency little fridge! This is a pretty neat little fridge, especially if you are limited on space. I've only had it about 2 weeks but so far it lives up to all expectations. It is VERY quiet. You can barely hear it when it is running and even then only if the room is otherwise silent. If there is any other low background noise in the room you won't hear it at all. It seems to be well insulated so it only runs very occasionally and it keeps everything cold. My past experience with small refrigerators was that they had to have the temp control turned up very high to keep things really cool but this one is an exception! I initially turned it pretty high (based on previous experience) but after 2 days found my liquids to be freezing so I turned it down little by little until I found just the right setting to keep things just above freezing and that setting is about "2". I think this refrigerator would work as a freezer if you left it turned to the highest setting! I chose this model mostly because it's efficiency rating was about the highest amongst small fridges. Only time will tell if that is factual but at least at this point I am very satisfied with the product.
Great Mini-Fridge I have had this product a few months now. I work from home, and use this in my home office (which was originally a bedroom) upstairs. It fits on a small table; so, it fits the space perfectly. Although we keep it pretty full, it chills everything super-fast, and keeps everything in it cold. We keep water, drinks, condiments and sometimes snacks in it. It is also super-quiet. Shipping was fast, the price was good, and it works great. I would definitely recommend this item.
Five Stars I love the size of it, perfect fit for our upstairs living room. Keeps drinks very cold.
Nice, quiet little fridge with a few drawbacks to consider This is a great little fridge, but there are some significant minuses to consider which are considerable enough to keep it from a perfect rating. I needed it in order to survive a kitchen reno and it has really come in handy for that. Plus: + It's quiet! Even small refrigerators are notorious noise-makers, but this one makes only a subdued whirr when it runs. + It's not going to fit a ton of stuff, but it stores more than I thought. Minus: - Frost builds up very quickly on the freezer section. - The temperature is not even throughout the fridge. Items stored on the handy little tray under the freezer section tend to freeze, but if you set the temperature control lower to avoid this, the rest of the items in the fridge do get cold enough. - The room for tall standing items doesn't fit much more than a one quart carton of milk or one wine bottle. There is room for 2 bottles to be laid on their sides on the shelves, but the shelf space is lost.
Wonderful! I don't usually write many reviews, but I had to let you all know how awesome this fridge is since it had some poor previous reviews. I bought the stainless steel color, and it did NOT get damaged during shipment and arrived ding and dent free! I've had this for a few months now and have had absolutely no issues with it. I use this to store breast milk bottles, since walking up and down two flights of stairs several times a night to the fridge in the kitchen was taxing this new mom. Best investment ever!
Perfect for storing breast milk at work Door was easy to reverse thanks to instructions I found here - none come with the fridge. Perfect size to fit under a desk and store expressed breast milk for those that don't want to keep it in a break room fridge.
Quiet, Compact Refrigerator Since I have some mobility issues due to chronic pain, and have an upstairs room in my daughters' home, I have turned my "corner entertainment center" into what I call my kitchenette. I actually do have my HDTV sitting on top of the entertainment center, then in the middle section of my kitchenette, I have a small microwave and sitting on top of that I have a 3-way combinational appliance which includes a 2-cup coffee maker + toaster oven + little hotplate. I purchased this compact refrigerator, which is the exact height of the lower part of the center, to complete my little kitchenette in my room so I can avoid so many trips up and down the stairs. This is a nice little fridge with a small freezer and a mechanical control with adjustable thermostat, which works very well. It is an Energy-saving model and I never hear sound coming from, it's just that quiet. The legs are adjustable and the door is reversible, and found it very easy to reverse, because I chose to reverse the opening direction of my model. I think this is a quality and well built compact refrigerator, and I do recommend this product.
Very Good Midea Stainless Steel Cube Refrigerator This is a good buy for anyone looking for a small compact refrigerator. Be sure to purchase the protection plan in case there are any problems. So far, it works fine and stays very cold. The space inside is limited since it is a cube refrigerator. However, the performance is outstanding.
Love my little fridge Love my little fridge. I use it at work and it fits a remarkable amount of food/beverages. The cold works extremely well and freezer too. There is NO noise that I can hear whatsoever. No humming or buzzing. Very pleased.
The size is perfect for a small space and it runs quiet The size is perfect for a small space and it runs quiet. Keeps food cold and has a small "freezer" type area that can keep frozen foods mildly frozen. Great if you're looking for a compact solution. We've fit about 2 x 12 packs of soda in here using the top and bottom shelf and door panel storage.
Recommended. Skeptical at first because this is some off brand that I never heard off (the instructs were written by someone who obviously is not a native English speaker). That said, it works well and we haven't had problems. Recommended.
Love my little white fridge Love my little white fridge! I bought if for putting my face oils and essential oils, to keep them fresh and healthy and at my convenience in my master bathroom. Not too big not too small. Perfection!
exceeded every expectation `had this a few months, now, I guess ... and I'm delighted. This being my first mini-ice-box, I hadn't realized that they could be (ARE) so quiet. Even when the compressor kicks 'on', one can barely hear it; more importantly, what you CAN hear is not at the least bit objectionable frequency ... soothing, in fact, if this were in a bed/dorm room. I was also happily surprised at how easily it worked. Even the lowest (i.e. warmest) temperature setting, brought the inside (where I placed a thermometer) down to 42* F; in other words, NO problem getting things as cold as needed. For the price, I couldn't be happier. In fact, I'm rather amazed. This strikes me as QUALITY product.
it was a great choice. Out of the box and plugged in I can't speak to the longevity; I've only had it a day. But in every other aspect, it was a great choice. Out of the box and plugged in, it reached a temperature of 34 degrees is short order. That's a little too cold; I'll raise it to 37. When running it consumes less than 50 watts. Between cycles, 0 watts. In 24 hours it consumed approx. 1/4 kilowatt-hour of electricity. That's less than 10 cents, no matter where you live. So, no worry that it's anti-green, energy hog. Finally, it measures approx. 50 dbA noise level one foot from the back. That's so quiet, for practical purposes, you can say it noiseless. What more could you want? A lower price? It's already a bargain.
I am happy! like it - came with a little ding at the bottom left corner door [probably delivery weight - USP agent most probably tried to save his back in the last moment on the precarious stairway here-grimace] - but it's a working excellent fridge - and I am happy!
I purchased this fridge for my office. I breast ... I purchased this fridge for my office. I breast feed and I pump when I am at work and I needed a place to store my milk.This fridge does the job. The "freezer" doesn't really freeze anything unless it's left overnight. Aside from that, it fits perfectly under my desk and it doesn't make a sound.
This fridge was great for a while but has started acting up (about ... This fridge was great for a while but has started acting up (about a year after use). So much ice has built up around the freezer inside that the freezer cover has popped off. Even after clearing the ice, it's back within a couple days and a lot of condensation builds up at the top of the fridge, near the freezer area. I will probably be replacing it since I've gotten to the point where I need to defrost the freezer every week or so.
I was very disappointed when I took it out of the box to ... It works... but it is bent from shipping. I was very disappointed when I took it out of the box to see all the damage to the outer metal it looks like someone kicked it down the stairs... I bought it as a gift foe my husband so he could keep all his own goodies and beer in his office, we didn't see the damage untill after he unwrapped and opened the box. :(
Quiet and easy to unpack Great Fridge! I've had it for about a month, in my office. It works flawlessly and is quiet. It was very easy to unpack as the box was in two pieces; the vertical part lifted right off the base so that I didn't have to wrestle it out of the box.
VERY cold It's a very good refrigerator. I was shocked at just how cold it is, I set it too cold and my drinks were ice. It's big enough for my red bull and AMP and coke. Very happy. Just be careful and don;t set it too cold.
Great little Refrigerator, but Rough Assembly, I Suspect! There will be good ones and duds. My gamble so far is worth it! My refrigerator came in a bit damaged. The gas tank in the back is loose because one screw was missing and the other was loose upon delivery. Other than that, it's awesome. If I have any issues, I'll let you know. Just be careful with the refrigerator's backside as it's not getting the precautions it ought to have. Make sure it's not leaking on arrival, or when you're taking it out. I didn't see any leaks so I plugged it in. It's keeping thinks nice and cold...my setting is on 3. I use mine as a refrigerator, but it can also be used as a freezer.
Great office refrigerator We rent a large house and our office is upstairs. We hated going downstairs for water or other cold snacks. This refrigerator was a perfect answer. Pros * Fits a decent amount of items * Doesn't take up a ton of space in a room * Organization inside is very helpful (shelves, etc) * Very quiet * You can set it up to open the door from either side. * Very easy to clean Cons * Doesn't get quite as cold as we'd like * Ice chest / Freezer doesn't really work all that great * Wish we could remove or change the pop/beer holder on the door. We have no use for it.
a corner of the "M" was bent out words and stuck my finger like a needle Had the fridge for a week. It's quiet and keeps stuff cold. Only problem I've had with it is that the actual unit has a metal "Midea" logo that's glued on the door. On my fridge, a corner of the "M" was bent out words and stuck my finger like a needle, so I'd be careful when unpacking. Other than that, so far it's been great.
Super cold and quiet! Super cold and quiet! I keep this in my bedroom for cold bottle of water. Very nice packaging very sturdy shipping - came to my house completely undamaged. Easy to install - and most importantly quiet!
It sits right next to the bed so noise is not good. Just plugged it in and its making noises. Hoping they go away so I put my star right in the middle to be fair. Strangely the price went up 30 dollars from what I paid for it. Hope I didn't get a lemon. Maybe its supposed to warm up. It sits right next to the bed so noise is not good.
Caution: very noisy unit. Caution, caution, caution. I bought this based on a review that says it is a quiet unit. After losing half a nights sleep I unplugged it. The compressor noise is about what you would expect for a very loud small fan but the real problem is the switching noise. Each time it switches the compressor on or off it makes a loudish pinging noise like a ping pong ball bouncing off a window. I'm a light sleeper and that much noise was disconcerting. However, it is cooling my bottled water. I am terrible at returning things so for the time being, I'll chock this up to a lesson learned and unplug it overnight.
Worked great until this morning STOPPED WORKING TODAY 3 DAYS PAST MY 30 DAY WINDOW TO RETURN IT! I. AM. LIVID. Worked great until this morning. Notice a pool of water at the bottom of the fridge. Didn't realize it was the defrosting freezer ice.
The only bad thing is that it comes with this plastic sheet ... This is the cutest little mini fridge, about half the size of the ones we used back in the dorms in college. The only bad thing is that it comes with this plastic sheet coating which comes off but is underneath the hinge of the door so you either have to remove the door to get it all off or have little pieces of plastic sticking out from the hinge
No!! I bought this for my son and it quit working in 6 months. Still under warranty, but it will cost me more in shipping than to buy another on.
Noisy! I've had the 1.6 cu ft mini fridge for a week now. I followed all of the instructions when setting it up. Upon plugging it in it started making a modestly loud gurgling or chirping sound. I assumed this was something that would eventually stop. A week later it still constantly makes the sound. This is not what I wanted for my office at work. I have not yet contact Midea's customer service and will update this review if the problem is solved.
Quiet and my father loves it. He's diabetic and ... Quiet and my father loves it. He's diabetic and sometimes needs something quick to eat. His refrigerator is in his room next to his bed.
Nice refrigerator I purchased this little refrigerator for my husband who is in a nursing home. It was easy to set it up. It chills fast but one caution. This little item does not hold as much as we'd like without the door being compromised. We found out the hard way when stuff wasn't getting cold. So buy it but don't expect to use it to the full capacity.
Affordable Way to Cool Your Food I bought the 1.6 cf fridge to take to work and keep under my desk. It fits really well and does exactly what I wanted it to. I have six 18oz bottles Pratico Kitchen 18oz Leak-Proof Glass Bottles, Juicing Containers, Water / Beverage Bottles - 6-Pack on the middle rack, laying down; and I can use the bottom for my food for the day and the freezer for food for the following days (kept in Rubbermaid containers. I got this product a month and a half ago and have had to defrost it only once. That isn't too bad considering that we average 60-80% humidity where I am. Defrosting took about 30 minutes until I could push the ice out into the included tray and dry the water with paper towels. I had it up and running soon after so it would be ready for Monday use. Just for your planning purposes, the fridge is a bit larger than a standard truck (I have a 2010 Altima), so you might have to transport it in the back seat. The box it came in was a little roughed up and the bottom of it fell out as soon as I opened it. That may have been the shipper's fault though. The instructions are laughable, containing a multitude of typos and grammar mishaps, but the product works!
Quiet and oh so Cold What a great bargain. This refrigerator may be small in size but on a setting of 2, liquids are extremely cold. It is the perfect size but the coldness is unimaginable. A bottle of juice in there for 3 days cause me to have an ice freeze. I will definitely recommend this to anyone in need of a small refrigerator, I am glad I took a chance on this brand. I have no regrets with this purchase.
Absolutely wonderful appliance! I purchased it mainly for my office ... Absolutely wonderful appliance! I purchased it mainly for my office space so I can have cold drinks while I work. The only regret is I wish I would've gotten one with a semi spacious freezer. I would've loved to store some goodies as well!
Great price for a well-rounded product This fridge is great. This size was cheaper than a few smaller sizes, so I went with it. The freezer is large enough to fit an ice tray or 2 and/or some frozen meals, and there are a good number of shelves in the fridge and on the door to hold a lot. The vertical can holder is great for holding quite a few cans, and it not super bulky.
Good little fridge I actually got this to hold my film in, since the production office is nowhere near the kitchen. It works great, holding lots of 35mm and 120mm rolls of film as well as ink for the printers. Would buy again. Introduces a bit of a hiss on speakers plugged into outlets in the same room but that's not the fault of the fridge.
Perfect for my office I ordered this mini fridge for my small office, and it is perfect. I was worried it would be noisy, but I sit right next to it all day and it's very silent. I do hear it (barely) when it kicks on, but it goes quiet again after about a second. I haven't tested the freezer comportment very much, but the refrigerator has kept dairy products, leftovers and sodas perfectly cold. No complaints!
Great Product! I searched all over for mini fridges before deciding on this one. I'm glad I chose this one. Unlike others reported, mine arrived without damage. It is very spacious and has worked great for us so far. I purchased insurance coverage in case it doesn't work out, but so far I've had no problems. It looks nice and I would recommend it to others.
... warned about this fridge is that it does not easily accommodate a gallon of milk (if you have condiments ... Main thing to be warned about this fridge is that it does not easily accommodate a gallon of milk (if you have condiments in the door, the door won't close). You have to lay the gallon of milk on its side on the shelf. Should've noticed it. The ad doesn't show anything the size of a gallon of milk on display.
:( I really wanted to like this fridge. It's set up well and holds everything I need without much trouble, plus it's a great size and opens and closes well, but I gave it almost a month and it's just plain annoying. Everyone saying this fridge is quiet is dead wrong. I bought it for my dorm room because it's made with "whisper proof technology" but it makes loud growling sounds every 10-20 which kind of sucks. You can adjust the freezer temperature inside, but all the settings are either as cold as the fridge itself or the depths of antarctica. The freezer temp also leaks into the rest giving all the food in the refrigerator part ice crystals even when it's on a lower setting. I'd except my complaints out of an older fridge, because those do tend to be glitchy and loud, but not from a brand new one:(
awesome office fridge i've had this in my office since march 2016 it just sits there in the corner being all quiet keeping my stuff cold. if i were to buy another one (which i will soon) i'll opt to get the bigger one 4.4 CU FT. I've had no problems so far. it doesnt leak, or freeze up.
Do not buy Fridge has been plugged in with nothing inside of it set on the middle temperature on the dial. (not all the way cold) has yet to become colder than room temperature. And had been plugged in for 5 days now. The room it's in is kept at 70°. And it is indoors. The fridge is a waste of money
Too loud The fridge was way too loud, so loud to the point where I took the trouble to take this 40 pound fridge to a UPS store to return it. I bought the Danby one instead and it was much quieter, though the Danby one looks less attractive in terms of appearance. The packaging also made it very hard to pack it back for return.
Mini Black "Dorm" Fridge Wonderful mini fridge. I can fit bread, butter, milk, fruit, etc. in this easily. It has great capacity. There is a separate area as a small freezer but it doesn't really work well. That's OK because I don't need it. I use this is in my office and it's fantastic - no more sharing the office fridge.
The mini frig does not have light when door is ... The mini frig does not have light when door is open. At least I don't see a lamp on the wall inside. When I set the temperature to 6 or 6.5, max is 7 which is coldest, it froze my broccoli placed right under the freezer box. So I set it to 5 if I don't have cooked meat, and 5.5 if I do. A little bit noisy when its motor runs.
Great unit. I underestimated the cooler power of this thing. Cranked it up and it froze the contents. For being such a little fridge it can really pack in the cold. Great unit.
Cold, quiet fridge So far, so good with this fridge. After hours of research, we settled on this fridge, and we've been really happy with it for the past couple of weeks. It's super quiet—we keep it near our bedroom but it doesn't disturb us at all with compressor noise, which we were worried about. Even when I'm right next to it, all I hear (sometimes) is a slight bubbling noise in the back. This fridge gets COLD, too. (In fact, our milk froze solid when I turned the knob to 75% of it's max cooling power, so keep that in mind!) It's also nice-looking—the chrome front is a nice touch.
Yes Amazon Delivers Refrigerators! I needed a small refrigerator because I had company coming and I wanted something they could put all their drinks in and not take over the kitchen refrigerator. I looked locally and I could not find one as cheap as I could here on Amazon. Can you believe that? I have Prime so it was delivered in 2 days. It works perfectly and is very cold. We actually had to turn it down because it froze the Watermelon we had stored in there.
Just What the Doctor Ordered Packaged very securely and was as easy as pie to open. All I had to do was cut the four box straps and the whole cardboard box top slid off ... Not a dent or scratch anywhere. I chose this unit to fit under my garage workbench and it has exceeded all my expectations ... It keeps my beverages cold, blends right in to the surroundings and minds it's own business without any noise whatsoever. It's obvious to me that Amazon and this manufacturer have been paying attention to customer feedback, because they sure got it right this time.
Pretty good This has worked great for me in my office. The only downside is that the cord is not that long. Otherwise, it keeps things nice and cold and is a great size that should fit under lots of types of desks.
Perfect size, quiet Bought this for my teen's room. Perfect size, quiet, came well packaged and in great condition. Plenty of room for sodas, juice packs/boxes, small water bottles and a snack or two. Great purchase for its purpose.
Arrived as expected. Directions suggest you hire a professional ... Arrived as expected. Directions suggest you hire a professional if you want to reverse the swing of the door. That would probably cost as much as the unit itself so make sure the door hinges are on the side you need before you order it
Silent and works good I am from China, and the brand "Midea" is a famous company in China. Works great in bedroom, silent so I can sleep well.
Ok fridge This is an ok fridge. Good size for work, I use mine for lunch and storing breast milk when I pump at work. The little freezer is a good size for a small ice pack like what comes with a Medela pump cooler, however the door to the freezer is flimsy and doesn't seal well. My freezer is all frosted over in a thick layer after only owning a couple months. For the price I guess it'll do.
A total disappointment i was totally disappointed having received this product all scratched and damaged. Wasted 30 mins of my time packing the mini fridge again and shipping it back to the manufacturer. See attached photos. Thank you
But this little fridge does sound like a storm or coffee pot brewing For chill affect this fridge gets 5 stars. It definitely does the job on getting your items cold. However, on noise it gets a 2.5 star. Others reported that the device is load and this is true. For me it is bearable because I'm using it in my office so I'm not trying to sleep or keep the area quite. But this little fridge does sound like a storm or coffee pot brewing.
Five Stars Perfect little frig to keep in our office. Very quiet.
Excellent for office, energy efficient and very quiet! This is the best small office fridge ever! It does the job but is super silent. I have it under my desk drawers in my office and barely know it is there. Highly recommend it if you are looking for something energy efficient, discreet, and silent for a small space like a work office.
I live in a crowded home so refrigerator space is scarce and a pain because everyone acts like they live alone This little guy has been my blessing, I live in a crowded home so refrigerator space is scarce and a pain because everyone acts like they live alone. So I bought this guy to save me the trouble and I gotta say I am very pleased. Is has a mini freezer and enough room for beverages and a weeks worth of food. I love my mini fridge
but it's pretty annoying for a long time It likes to groan a lot and make weird noises. It's not impossible to get used to, but it's pretty annoying for a long time. Otherwise, it does a decent job, but the freezer is pretty worthless unless you have it set cold enough to turn the whole thing into a freezer.
does it get things 'cold'? Sure. By FDA standards (< 40f). No. It's been powered on for 3 days with only 6 cans of La Croix, about a quart of milk in the door rack, and a couple small jars of prescription drugs - all well spaced. I have two Taylor Digital ThermometersTaylor Digital Refrigerator Freezer Thermometer: 1x hanging from the steel-wire rack, center fridge and the other in the 'freezer' compartment. These thermometers record lowest, highest and current temps. The thermometer in the refrigerator reads a low of 45f, with infrequent door openings (only about twice a day). The freezer, maybe a couple of degrees lower. Maybe it's because my (non-air-conditioned) apartment is bout 75-80 degrees? Or maybe my expectations were too high? Maybe smaller refrigerators generally don't perform as well as their larger brethren (however, the technology is the same, hasn't changed much since inception and you'd think a smaller container would be easier to chill than a larger). If you're just planning on using it to chill drinks, it should be fine. Perishables? I wouldn't chance it. On the plus side, it is relatively quiet and ground shipping from Atlanta to Chicago (non-Prime) only took 2-days,
I realize there are always product lines that have units which go bad sooner than they should I bought this based on the reviews. Unfortunately, it only lasted six (6) months. I realize there are always product lines that have units which go bad sooner than they should, but this refrigerator is as basic as it can be with minimal components. I do not think being operational for one half of a year is acceptable. Also, no returns are possible after one (1) month.
This coolant for the unit I received didn't work at ... This coolant for the unit I received didn't work at all and the fridge has never worked. Fulfilled by Amazon and they don't accept returns after 30 days. Will buy my next one locally. Save your money.
Very good mini frig Very good mini frig. Got the 4.4 cubic foot model. Keeps drinks/good consistently cold on low setting and is very quiet. I have it in in my bedroom near my bed. Don't get this frig however if you need a respectable size freezer. Freezer is very small with respect to the overall size of the frig and freezer door is very flimsy. I accidentally broke mine off after only a week so you have to be very careful with it. Overall 4 stars for the price/size ratio and so far keeps stuff very cold consistently and is quiet.
Nice fridge! Nice, clean looking fridge. It runs quietly and has plenty of storage for small items like yogurt, carton of milk, cans of soda, bottles of water (although will not fit on the bottom if laid with lid facing out). Top shelf will hold small food containers. I do wish I had purchased a fridge without a freezer compartment, it's only been a month and already needs defrosting. Seems like a good fridge and would recommend if you don't mind defrosting once a month.
made it absolutely perfect for my space Ordered this as a replacement for a dying, twenty-five year old refrigerator in my office. While the size was important, the fact that this particular unit had a reversible door, made it absolutely perfect for my space.
in perfect shape and is quiet as a mouse OK, I had reservations on this little guy but after seeing all the positive feedback I purchased it for my boat. Ya I know it's only AC but why pay $1000 for AS/DC just to kill your batteries while out at sea. I just want it to chill my beers so when I stop by the boat to relax, I have a cold one waiting for me. Here's the trick, put a blue ice in the freezer section while your away from the dock. I bring a cooler with me when I leave the dock and don't open the frig that much. I can't believe that for only $88, you can buy a refrig/freezer that actually is quiet. It arrived on time, in perfect shape and is quiet as a mouse, I have to open it to make sure it's working. It also makes ice just fine...for $88 I'm extremely happy
Gorgeous! Perfect little fridge! I got it for the den next to my rooftop deck and its perfect to go into quickly and get water, etc. Keeps foods cold for the next picnic. Loved that its wood grain, different.
Otherwise it works like a dream This mini fridge is cold and quiet. I would definitely purchase this again. The only downside is that it takes a bit to get the chemical smell out of the fridge initially. Otherwise it works like a dream!
Spacious Mini Fridge Great mini fridge. I bought this for the office to keep drinks cold. It's really spacious compared to similar models and best of all for the price of some other tacky colored fridges you get stainless steel!
Good Water Fridge Very quite when cycling. Doesn't appear to leak anywhere. Keeps things consistently cold. Does what it's supposed to do, which is keep bottled water cold upstairs.
... it for a few months now and it works great! At first Have had it for a few months now and it works great! At first, it did have a little bit of annoying white noise... but it seems to be gone now. I'm impressed with how cold this thing stays — you might freeze things if you put them underneath the freezer compartment. Just something to be aware of if you *don't* want something to accidentally freeze. Perfect size for a discreet under-desk-fridge.
Nice product, bad shipping Nice refrigerator and size works will and light weight, however it came very damaged. Both corners are smashed in the back and there are dents on the door. There is also a large scratch/dent on one of the sides.
Perfect fridge for water and drinks This is a compact and incredibly convenient mini-fridge. I keep mine in the corner of a bedroom and am able to keep quite a lot of bottled water, drinks and the occasional snack. I would not recommend keeping foods with a bit of odor in there as it will smell up the fridge. Temperature can be set form 1 (warmer) - 6 (coldest (even partially freezes some water bottles closer to the freezer section).
Love all the door storage The refrigerator does exactly what we expected. Cold and quiet. Love all the door storage. Shelf storage is very strange but does appear to function well. 4 stars only! Packing is terrible! As noted by many others, there was a BIG DENT on the corner. It bent the motor brace. It took about half hour to SLOWLY straighten everything out. It is quiet, now that the motor sits correctly.
The refrigerator is a perfect size to keep quite a few small bottles juice The refrigerator is a perfect size to keep quite a few small bottles juice, soda, etc. and maybe a few pieces of fruit or a snack. It keeps cold and is very attractive. We picked the wood grain for my mother's room in an assisted living facility because she has very nice furniture and it matches perfectly. We have it on top of a low file cabinet so she can reach it easily.
Great little fridge!! We read the reviews before purchasing and glad we did not listen to a few negative ones. We have this outside in a pool cabana. We keep it reasonably full, not over stuffed. Everything has worked beautifully and it keeps things as cold as my inside fridge. Love the glass door so you can see in without having to open to see if it needs to be restocked. Also we did change the direction of the door opening. It took about 10 minutes and could not have been easier. Not sure where the negative reviews came from. This is truly a great little fridge even in the heat of the summer!!
The door looks nice on the outside.... Showed up damaged. Someone took the time to put a makeshift foot on the bottom as the other had been busted off during shipping or transit. Also, the ice maker tray was hanging inside by one of its three screws. The others stripped out laying in the floor. Think the thing was dropped hard and that's what caused both areas of damage. In regards to being a "freezer" also. One little tray. Just fyi. Extremely disappointed.
It's good to have one at home but THIS THING IS ... It's good to have one at home but THIS THING IS LOUD. You hear the sound from compressor, its fine, every fridge doing that, but you also can hear the water travel sound from it AND ITS LOUD. By several week uses i feel fine with this mini fridge, it does the job and have no issue, but louder than i thought. That's all problem.
Good fridge. I purchased this refrigerator to replace the one in my pop up. The old dual fuel camper fridges wear out. I'll start with the packaging, wow. Nothing could have happened to damage it. It was still easy to open too. Shipping was either on time or a day early, which is normal with my Amazon experiences. My installation was a little involved, but I wanted it in the original fridge location. I had to trim 3/4" off each side of the wood to get it in there. Once inside, there was about 1" to each side, but anyways. I plugged it in and set my temperature dial to the desired temp and it cooled down real quick. When I go camping I won't need to bring so many coolers.
So I am a little bit disappointed.. Was quiet for a month than became as noisy as my big fridge. I bought it mainly to lover the noise level in my apartment. So I am a little bit disappointed... Other then that the fridge is OK. You use it as a cheap vine fridge with a little freezer big enough for 2 big cans of beer. It will take about an hour to cool down 2 cans in the freezer to 40F, so it is not a rapid freezer by any means.
A good mini fridge. It's OK. Works fine, looks fine. It's in our bedroom. Gurgles a lot when it runs. Seems like it runs a lot. I wish it didn't have a freezer. Don't really need that and itakes up too much space for other tall stuff I have to put in laying down. I probably didn't do a good enough job reading all the details before I ordered.
Awesome! Awesome little fridge! Freezer works great for my frozen fish food and the regular fridge portion will actually freeze drinks if set on the lowest temp. If keeping beer I wouldn't set it on the lowest temp, it actually froze some twisted teas and some bud lights have been a little slushy once I opened them lol. Highly recommended tho
Don't be scared by other reviews This fridge was in surprising condition after seein everyone else saying they got theirs with a dent in it and mine came with no scuffs. The only problem came with the plug which came bent but with a little bit of a pull put it back into place. The box was very badly beaten but the package was safe. Definitely worth buying
I have enjoyed the mini refrigerator for the past 2 months I have enjoyed the mini refrigerator for the past 2 months. I use it in my salon suite and it is concealed perfectly under a chair so that no one ever realizes that I have cold beverages until I open it up and get them one out of the refrigerator. It has been a great find and I recommend it for anyone.
HOT TO TO THE TOUCH! Just received refrigerator, plugged it in and is cooling now but the outside is so hot on the sides I cannot hold my hand there. Maybe this is normal as it begins cooling and will subside but is concerning. Will wait until until tomorrow to decide if this out of ordinary and update rating.
... up last night when I heard a little Noise like water boiling/leaking and the noise was from the Refrigerator ... I woke up last night when I heard a little Noise like water boiling/leaking and the noise was from the Refrigerator in my bedroom with the Insulin's type M and A in it . That was making noise either after I turning it off/on. My question is: Should I do something ells to make it quite (normal) or I have to send it back, and replace that? Thank you for helping me to know. Also, by listening to my caregiver manager's opinion, and my caregiver's past experience about this size. That is why I decided and returned it back, and did not accepted another new one, and I want to get credit the same price that I paid for, back on my Store credit Card Balance if possible, and please forget about the head aches.

Cute and very cool! This is a great compact fridge. Perfect for my office. It's quiet, has a lot of room for all my snacks and lunch things, and it keeps everything just cold enough. I've had it for about 6 months now and I've only had to defrost it once (there was a very small amount of frosty business built up in the freezer part). I was hesitant to purchase because I didn't recognize the brand name, but this fridge is great!
Midea WHS-121LB1 Compact Single Reversible Door Refrigerator and Freezer, 3.3 Cubic Feet, Black I did a lot of research and pricing from different sites and decided on this fridge. I ordered it on June 22nd new for $91.25 and received it via UPS on the 29th in an undamaged box. The refrigerator is in perfect condition and is beautiful! I am impressed! I had never heard of Midea until I started looking for a mini fridge. I've only had large refrigerators in the past and had no knowledge of mini fridges and could not imagine what 3.3 cu ft looked like. I was amazed at: how roomy it is inside, how fast it got cold & froze items, and at how quiet it is. It is so quiet I thought it wasn't working. Then after a couple days of running, I had to turn down the dial because it was freezing my milk ... I mean this thing is really nice, and I got a really good deal! I love it! especially since I see the exact same one is $179.39 one month later. My large fridge stopped cooling a couple of months ago and was unplugged and WOW what a difference in my electric bill. I will never buy a large refrigerator again. This is suppose to run $26.00/year. My large one was pulling more than that in a month. Anyway I'm glad I decided to go this way instead of a service call ... I'm sure that would have run more than 91.00 ... plus my new beautiful black Midea is conveniently located in my bedroom under the air conditioner keeping the back of the refrigerator nice and cool. If I do need more room in the future I'm going to use this for a freezer and get another mini refrigerator without a freezer ... lol ...
Great little fridge! Great refrigerator. Used at work to store breastmilk pumped during the work day. Serves this purpose well. Keeps milk cold, fits under the desk well and is pretty quiet. It seemed the refrigerator at work wasn't as cold packed with everybody's personal stuff so this is a huge improvement (the piece of mind knowing it's not being tampered with is nice too) Packaged well and came without damage. Update: this little refrigerator is still going strong stays cold keeping the valuable milk cold all day long. Perfect size to fit under a desk. It is quiet too! Hardly notice it while running during the workday. No complaints from the office mate in regards to noise
faulty appliance it didn't work!!! called for replacement waiting for it .......
adequate Everything about it is acceptable other than the door which is half unusable. I think the half is set up to hold 4 or 5 cans and dispense them. Worthless to me.
One Star This refrigerator died after just a few months.
Nice little fridge! This small fridge is a great addition for on top of a counter. We use this fridge in a meeting room and we fill it with just a few pops and a few waters. It is great size as a small beverage fridge. However, I would not recommend it if the customer needs to freeze anything as the freezer is very small and I would personally consider it unusable. But all in all, this is a great fridge for a small beverage fridge and I would recommend it for a college dorm as well.
Freezer works fantastic and the fridge gets super cold Spent a lot of time researching small refrigerators and this one was well worth it. Freezer works fantastic and the fridge gets super cold. I don't even need to use the highest setting to keep this thing cool. Stores food with plenty of room.
and we love it! It's the perfect size My fiancé and I just bought this fridge for our house warming party, and we love it! It's the perfect size, you can put a six pack of be.., soda in here, candy bars in the freezer, yogurt. It's perfect as our beer fridge as our other fridge hardly fits all of our food and adult beverages. This is a nice extra spot for extra cool storage. Love it! It's a lot bigger than the normal mini fridge, it was packaged really well too. Couldn't be happier!
Paid for New, Got Used and Dirty Instead The product I received is clearly used, despite the fact that I paid for a new one. There are deep scratches and smudges all over the exterior of the refrigerator, and the inside contains what appear to be small food particles and a greasy residue. I bought the refrigerator to store pumped milk at work and thus do not have the time to return it and go without for however many days it takes to get a new one (which could also show up used and dirty). I am so unhappy with this purchase.
Great little fridge for the $$. So here's the thing... you're asking to SHIP a refrigerator... Fact is, the packaging is good, but depending on the carrier, it could get beat up. That's not the fault of the product, it's the fault of the shipping. My guess is, that the majority of damage/broken/not working issues are due to shipping problems. Lucky for me, mine arrived in perfect condition, and has been working flawlessly since I first plugged it in. Keeps my beer and soda nice and cold. Doesn't over-frost up. For the money - great little fridge.
stopped working less than 60 days This fridge i received on Mar. 31, 16 has stopped working!! It was used n my bedroom for cold water bottles & sodas. Only 2 mos., got insur on it too & will c what happens next. Soo disappt.
Very Nice fridge for the price Very Nice fridge for the price, bigger than I thought, keeps things cold. It is not noisy, and is very quite, it blends in with the rest of the environment. It has a dial to say how cold you want it, which is a very nice feature and it could get cold.
Exterior Flaws. Just received it in the mail 10 minutes ago. 2 complaints right out of the gate: Showed up damaged. Back corner on the top was bashed in to be exact. I don't think it has anything to do with the seller, probably happened during shipping and cant fault the seller for that. It's wobbly. I don't know how else to describe it. The 2 legs on the bottom are uneven and can't be re positioned so if any pressure is applied on top it wobbles, noticeably. This might not be a problem for some but i intended to place my coffee maker on top of it (I'll be using it at work and lack the desk space) so this could get messy/burny real quick.
Really nice food storage I just need a mini fridge in my bedroom, so I can have my own storage of food and drinks. It is because my siblings often eat my food or drink my beer whenever I put it in our fridge. It's very annoying, really. That's why I decided to buy this fridge. I love it by the way.
No problems, only satisfaction ! Just what I needed for my office/tv room. Extremely quiet, plenty of room for one to store needed essentials and freezer compartment that works. No problems, only satisfaction !
Just right Just the right size, does not start very often, energy efficient.
... drinks ok but the noise it makes is very annoying. Between the buzzing the gurgling noise It chills my drinks ok but the noise it makes is very annoying. Between the buzzing the gurgling noise, it's very distracting to have in my office.
I saw a lot of questions as to how much ... I saw a lot of questions as to how much the fridge can hold, which was my concern as well. It can hold a 24 pack of water. It also isn't very loud.
I'm extremely disappointed in this item as it has a large dent ... I'm extremely disappointed in this item as it has a large dent in the door. It is a stainless steel door so it is very obvious. It also has to be turned to its highest setting to make items inside cold. I would return it if it wasn't difficult and expensive to return a refrigerator.
Shipping problems Shipping problems the fed ex man advised me he received it laying on its side and this should have never been it is a refrigerator so I had to wait 24-48 hours before plugging it in & hoped for the best and I was lucky it works fine.These people need to make the shipping instructions clear THIS SIDE UP!
Sparks fly out of back of unit Fridge keeps items cold but looks like there is leakage in the back which causes the unit to shoot a spark every now and then. I'm guessing others haven't noticed this. My unit is in my guest room and my guest was on the phone before sleeping and saw the sparks happen multiple times. I was surprised to hear this given the high reviews but this was confirmed again and definitely is not safe for home use, unless you want your home/apartment to burn down.
Worked for about 3. 5 weeks, but then ... Worked for about 3.5 weeks, but then crapped out. At least the return period was still valid and the return process was fairly painless...
We have one and love it no dents It arrived at my Fathers house with a Dent the size of a softball in front. He waited along time for it. Had already taken out of Box. I told him he could retun it. He is 87 and did not want to deal with returning. We have one and love it no dents. The refrigerator is great.
Works very well After I placed it in our basement I just let it sit unplugged for a few hours (as per instructions) to help prevent any start up problems. It is pretty quiet when on and manually setting the temperature to the middle brought the temperature down to 37-40 in 24 hours when empty. Fits my corny keg and 5 lbs CO2 tank perfectly. I can probably fit a second keg but the CO2 tank may not fit then. I removed all shelving for this to fit. The dimensions of the largest void in the front is 18 x 10.5 x 28. The back of the fridge is 20 inches from ceiling to base.
Perfect! Bought this for my mom who lives and sleeps in a very small room. It is wonderful! so very quiet, you don't even know its there! Its almost just like another piece of furniture! Interior space is very small, but is great to store just a few drinks and has a shelf for just a couple items. Its perfect.
I like the can holder set up and overall this is ... shipment arrived damaged (Large dent in the middle of the front door)...response for return/replacement was immediate and the replacement arrived quickly, in the meantime i did use the machine for a few days, the machine kept our water bottles very cold. This machine runs very quiet, we have it in a small (12x12) workout room and we cannot hear it all. I like the can holder set up and overall this is a great little fridge....Damage was no fault of the seller and yet the replacement process was extremely easy and painless...I highly recommend this fridge for both the product and customer service!!!
Good fridge to start - makes noises now This refrigerator was a dream for the first few weeks I had it set up. It looks nice and professional in my office. It does a good job cooling the sodas I wanted to keep in there. However, in the last few days it has started to make a "grinding" noise when it is working. It was silent / not noticeable before, and now it is making annoying noises... Still a good price / deal, but it is driving me mental in my office
Keeps Drinks Very Cold! I bought two of these compact refrigerators to go next to the two desks in my game room. They fit perfectly and keep things very cold! Almost too cold! I have to turn the dial down a notch to keep my Dr Peppers from freezing.
This is a great little fridge This is a great little fridge! I put it in my room. No damage to mine like other reviews. Got it today, saw a reveiw that said it stopped working after a month so hopefully that does not happen! As of now this was a great purchase!
The fridge is a great mini fridge The fridge is a great mini fridge. It fits about 2 6-packs and about 5 bottles of water. The star I removed was because I received it upside down and with the plastic straps missing. Normally something with coolant needs to be shipped upright. The fridge is working great regardless.
Five Stars Really good, reliable fridge. I've been using it for 6 months with no issue.
Noisy fridge Thought that it would be nice to have a small fridge upstairs to place the leftover baby milk during the middle of the night but it is somewhat annoying to hear the crackling sounds it makes off and on.
A fridge like this should be found in your home Literally cool little fridge. I love this so much! :)
I would have rather spent $50 more to get a better freezer It only holds one quart of milk in the door and the "freezer" compartment door opens from the bottom so if even a little bit of ice builds up around the unit, the door does not open very far and pops off if i try to open it very wide. Not worth the money. I would have rather spent $50 more to get a better freezer compartment
Midea Compact Refrigerator I needed a small refrigerator I could keep cold drinks, and a few refrigerated staples in. This little beauty arrived on time, and was well packaged. No nicks or dings or shipping damage at all. When I first plugged it in, I wasn't sure it was even running. It's amazing how quiet this little refrigerator runs. The freezer compartment is very small, so if you need freezer space it probably isn't a great choice. The only real problem I had was finding a place to set it since the cord is a bit on the short side so if you don't have an outlet near the spot you want to set it, you might have problems.
FALSE ADVERTISING: DENTED right out of the box -- should be discounted and sold as "scratched and dented" floor model Arrived with sizable dent in the corner of the door. Box seemed packed fine to protect the edges. Looks like it came from the manufacturer that way. Poor quality control. I've noticed MANY other reviewers who said theirs came with dents. Why doesn't Amazon on the manufacturer give partial credits since we thought we were buying NEW items, only to get "scratched and dented" floor models, which are typically discounted in big box stores. Pitiful quality control. Other than that disappointment, the unit runs and cools.
Satisfied Customer in Maryland! This item is wonderful! It keeps my husband's beer very cold and it sometimes freezes my bottled water. Also, this item is a nice looking item, even though it sustained a couple dings during the shipping process. Overall, a great bang for the buck!
Junk don't buy Stopped working 2 months after purchase
Not Happy not quite 4 months and it quit working
Amazing. Exactly what I wanted plus much more. It is very very quite, has decent enough space and the freezer works well. It came dented in a corner, however, would still order from this company. Absolutely love. Thank you .
This is An okay product But I still feel like it was a waste of money This is An okay product But I still feel like it was a waste of money. It completely stopped working the month I got it! It was also a little noisy and bothered me when i was in the room! But when it was working, it did keep my cans really cold and nice
arrived damaged / appears funtion but need replacement part Item appears to be functional as i have jusy received and plugged it in, however the plastic cover for the hinge arrived broken. Please replace asap. Everything else APPEARS to be ok so far... only time will tell. Will raise rating once part is received and I can verify unit functions 100%
The fridge itself was good and exactly what we expected The fridge itself was good and exactly what we expected. The packaging, however, left much to be desired. The box was broken and the fridge was dented in several places. We needed it desperately as our refrigerator had broken so we did not return it.
Poor Quality Like so many others reported, it came dented. Worked fine at first and you can barely hear it run. Now, after a couple of months it won't freeze and I cannot get it below 44 degrees. Look elsewhere
Never started working I purchased this as a gift for my mother, and it arrived quickly in 3 days. My mom is a diabetic who required insulin and really wanted to keep her medication separate from the food. She opened it and had to get a special table for it to sit on so did not try it for 2 days, when she finally connected it, she followed instructions and it never started cooling. I can only hope that this doesn't happen to anyone else!
Decent size and looks good in my office Decent size and looks good in my office. 3 stars because it's tricky to determine the right setting to keep produce from freezing while still keeping the freezer cold enough for ice.
For a Good Time, Get This Mini-Fridge I needed a mini fridge in my room because I'm too lazy to go downstairs where the kitchen is and was very thirsty for a cold drink! THis one in particular stood out to me because of its fair price and small size.
Cooler It does the job if you don't need a large interior. It's both small on the inside and out. It works for me to keep bottled water and soft drinks available in my office.
Totally not worth buying! Unpacking saw the appearance of the edge of the refrigerator, there are several bending deformation is not on time delivery, very bad product, not worth buying.
Great for the office I bought this mini-fridge for work, and it's working great. Our other mini's have issues with the freezer icing up and this has remained ice free. It is very light, easy to move, great value.
Solid mini fridge This is a great little refrigerator with more than enough capacity for my use (in a home officer) and relatively quiet too; honestly, the computer I have sitting on top of it is probably a fair bit louder than it is. It is also capable of taking a few hard knocks without any apparent cosmetic defects.
Mini fridge Have had it for a few days and it's great. It's works really good and it's super quiet. Plenty of room for my water, juice, fruits and other things. It's a space saver. It can't with no dents or anything. Am very pleased with my purchase.
it's a little cube fridge for a good price that works as-advertised What can I say, it's a little cube fridge for a good price that works as-advertised. I love having cold drinks in the garage now! :D
I've had bad experience with other double door mini fridge/freezer Actually was not a single door product but double doors. I've had bad experience with other double door mini fridge/freezer,but hoping this one will prove me wrong and both components will keep working!!
Four Stars Good. Relatively quiet if sleep in another room. Rattle often comes from the plastic try...just need to reposition it.
5/10 I was excited when it first came. But after the first week i realized how much a light bulb is needed in order to see what's in there. Secondly the freezer wasn't as cold as I expected and to finish it off the door on the freezer broke off. Wouldn't recommend because you can find comparable ones for the same price with inside lights and better organization options:
A perfect fit! I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas for his office. He loves it! It's not too loud and just the right size.
in and it has been working great for me Bought this for my office at work to keep my lunch, bottles of water, etc. in and it has been working great for me.
Sleek & functional, what more can you ask for Not too loud, sleek & functional. Even has a small freezer compartment which was a nice surprise for me. THUMBS UP
Cheap The rubber seal won't keep door shut so the product won't stay cold and has frost build up on freezer compartment.
Four Stars Does it's job but the Freezer seems to be too cold and ices over the little compartment
Great design extremely quite I bought this for work. Great design extremely quite. very happy with the purchase.
Bottle beer its not so great unless you like most of your beer bottles on ... Its a little temperamental on keeping it too cold or not cold enough. It holds a lot of bottled water. Bottle beer its not so great unless you like most of your beer bottles on their side. Otherwise good unit.
Five Stars Great product. I have it in my bedroom closet and it's quiet & works perfectly.
Could be better Would have gave a better rating if the refrigerator did not arrive with a big dent in it.
Five Stars Recommend this product! Audible noise, but wouldn't call it noisy at all!
